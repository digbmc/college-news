Interesting and authentic college news
every week! That is what is within our
reach now that Bryn Mawr is to publish
a weekly. It ought to bea very special
boon to us, as alumnee, thus to be able to
keep in touch with Bryn Mawr’s daily
happenings; for, after all, it’s the con-
tinuity of detailed information that keeps
up our interest in things.

Can Bryn Mawr support a weekly news -
sheet with the “Typ” and “Lantern”? we
hear alumne and undergraduates ask. But
instead of asking’ let’s do it. As alumne
surely we can do our share and that a large
one. We can encourage the board by ex-
pressions of our approval; we can stimu-
late the board to greater effort. by our ex-
pressions of disapproval, ‘and we can all
subscribe,

Yours sincerely,

AN ALUMNA.

To the Editors:

The impression has gone abroad that
class government is becoming less and
less democratic, which means __ that
classes are getting further and further



| ber

away from the fundamental principle of
|Bryn Mawr College. In the matter of
iclass government, it has occurred to us
\that the following plan, if carried out in

| spirit rather than in letter, might solve

‘the difficulty. At the expiration of the

| six. weeks’ term of the temporary offi-
|cers a president shall be elected by the
| class.

At the same time each hall shall
lelect a representative. These represen-

tatives, together with the president, shall
| constitute the Board of Directors of the

class and shall choose from their num-
the other officers. Matters of im-
portance shall be discussed by the Board
and submitted to each hall by the hall
representative before being given to the
vhole class for decision. The hall rep-
resentative must realize that—she—m-ry
never act as an individual, but as a rep-
resentative of her hall. In carrying out
the full spirit of such a plan it would
logically come about that each member
of the class would have’ an opportunity
to share in the work of the class. It
might be a good plan in the larger un-
dertakings, such as a class play, for the
Board of Directors to apportion the work
to the different halls as nearly evenly as
possible, giving each hall its own definite
responsibility. The bond that will hod
a member most closely to her class is the
realization that she is an integral part of
its life and this realization will.come only
through having shared in the varied ac-
tivities of her class.

For years at Bryn Mawr we have been .
getting into a rut. Day after ‘day we have
been driven by routine over the tradi-

deeper and deeper until, before we real-

world out. No longer able to gaze upon
the outside world, we looked constantly
down the narrow path. Our point of view
was completely changed. We lost sight
of the vital things in looking constantly
upon the scholastic things. We were
helpless to climb out of the rut by our-
selves. Some of us did not even want
to get out. But at last from the “new
organ” we hear the note of live interest
in the outside world, of free thought. It
rouses us; it stimulates us; we hope it
may ever give us a lift out of the rut."

PROF. FREDERICK A. CLEVELAND

“Frederick Aldrich Cleveland, Professor .
‘of Modern «European History at Bryn
Mawr College, died yesterday from tuber-
culosis at Saranac Lake, N. Y., in his
thirty-ninth year. Professor Cleveland
was born in Palmyra, N. Y., and was the
son of ‘the late Frederick E. Cleveland, a
‘lawyer of this city, and Mrs. Catherine
Sexton Aldrich Cleveland, of Palmyra,
who survives him. He was graduated
from Cornell University, from which he
received the degree of B.A. in 1899. Dur-
ing his college career he was one of the
‘editors of: ‘The Sun,’ ‘Widow,’ and ‘Lit-
erary Monthly.’ Professor ‘Cleveland
was a member of the fraternities of Alpha
Delta Phi and Phi Beta Kappa. From
| 1900 until 1904, he was a member of the

A Tribute to Mr. Cleveland

The death of Mr. Cleveland cannot
mean so much to those who did not know
him in his College work. He was. not
| here long and many people did not study
""under him. Yet to those of us whose
| good fortune it was to be in his classes,
the news of his death comes with tragic
|'suddenness. He was perhaps one of the
‘most thoroughly popular’ professors
jamong his students. Many of us had
|cherished the hope that he would return
to resume his position here.

The service that Mr. Cleveland ren-
|dered by his efficient work remains, fos-
tered by the rare inspiration he gave his
;students. What we have lost, and what
we try now to recaJl, is the man. He had
a certain simplicity and frankness, min-
gled with a shy geniality that was delight-
ful. His whimsical vein of talk and his
‘dry wit made his lectures alive. Always
emphatic, he never failed to add droll
side-lights; always accurate, he never
lost the charm of picturesque language.
He was a scholar and an historian; but
he was first of all a man whose life we
are glad to remember. ‘

THE COLLEGE NEWS



CURRENT NUMBER OF THE
“TYPN O’BOB”

Reviewed by Christine Hammer, '12

The -first issue of “The Tip” for the
- year 1914-1915 has just come into my
~ hands. As an alumna who knew “The
Tip” in her day as a diversely conveni-
ent college “organ,” I want to send
through “The College News,” the new
college “organ,” a short notice in regard
to “The Tip.”~ By its editorial confes-
sion “The Tip” admits this year to be
a crucial one in its career, for its “raison
d’etre” is to be tested by apparent com- |

petition. | should like to say here that
I believe



s “raison d’etre” will be posi-
tively established, for (I quote “The Tip” |
editorial) “ideas literary or —_—
humorous or serious, whether form
of story or verse’ should prove accep-
table to the College, if the contents of |
the present number of ‘The Tip’ may be

taken as typical in their “readableness,

and interest.”

The editorial, for example, is readable, |
except for an occasional curious lapse,
such as “fortuitous career,” either of edi-
torial vocabulary or of proof-reading. It.
is a frank statement of the possible pre-
eariousness of the _ situation in which
“The Tip” finds itself at the moment, and
by its very frankness is a spirited chal-
lenge to the friends of “The Tip” to rally
to its support.

“The White Papers” gives interestingly
a timely comparison of the pre-war com-
munications of England and Germany
with other European nations. The writ-
er’s emphatic assertion, that the German
White Papers were ‘tremendously inter-_
esting [to her] as an exposition of the

‘German point of view, [making her] won-
der whether Germany’s fears may not be
well founded,” should rouse those who do
not already know the papers to pass judg-
ment for themselves.

“The Broken Step” does consistently
what it sets out to do: tells a mystery
story. The proper atmosphere is rather.
well given both by the general setting
and by the specific detail.
osity is adequately stimulated. by the
opening situation; is carried successfully
through several obscurities; and _ is
finally completely satisfied by the grue-
some solution.

The poem, “Brighidin Mavrone,” has,
very appropriately, the incisiveness, the
compactness, the héeigtened power of sug-
gestion of the old English ballads. Its
technique, however, is not beyond re-
proach. For example, the point of view.
is quite unnecessarily confused, being
successively that of three different peo-
ple; first that of the lover (‘Bridget my
sorrow’); then that of a mere spectator
(‘her beauty’); lastly that of a dramatis
persona addressing the lady - (“you

One’s curi-—



walk”). However, if the first point of
view, that of the lover, were consistently
kept, the first line of the third stanza
would read: —

“My sisters wrap me ina shroud.”

“Pages from a Munich Diary” seems to
me excellent for its
imaginative reflection of the temper of
the German people in the early days of
the war: of their. first, brief, excited
gaiety; then of their puzzled, silent
amazement; of their final sorrowful, re-
solved loyalty. :

The review of “The Secrets of the Ger-

-man. War Office” exhibits the disadvan-

tages of an all-embracing “sense of the
serious,” a sense seriously recommended
in College Convictions!

In concluding, I speak in a riddle: “Is
the College yet reduced to ‘giving up the
salad course’?”

VARSITY-PHILA. C. C. GAME

Varsity was defeated by Philadelphia
Cricket Club, 4-3, last Saturday.
Varsity _line-up_was:—R.-Tinker, M. Mor-
gan, H. Chase,. D- Alexander, G. Emery,
V. Litchfield, M. Branson, W. Weaver, M.
Thompson, J. Pauling and F. Curtain.
For the first ten minutes there was hard

playing around. Varsity's goal, resulting |

in two, goals for Philadelphia. After this
Varsity picked up and Alexander scored
a goal. Varsity showed a decided im-

provement over last week and had more |

fighting spirit, but lacked speed and as-
surance.

ran the Varsity halfbacks. Often Mor-

gan, Tinker and Emery, making long |

dribbles down the field, thrilled the side-

lines in €xpectation of a goal, but the ball)

was usually lost at the crucial moment.
Noticeable for its success was Philadel-

phia’s defence formation, the goal and
fullbacks forming an almost impassable

barrier. Varsity’s defence was, on the
contrary, very feeble.
Varsity showed more determination, and
Philadelphia was held in check. Litch-
field played a hard and steady game
throughout. H. Harris was called upon to
play. Alexander and Morgan made a
goal each, bringing the final score to 4-3.

“Germany and the Next War,” by Gen-
eral Friedrich von Bernhardi

The most scholarly presentation of the
German point of view toward the world
and toward themselves is to be found in
Jeneral Friedrich von Bernhardi’s book
“Germany and the Next War.” Whatever
else one may say of the volume, it is
a scholarly presentation of the German
side of the question. Those who pretend
to an intelligent interest in this world
cataclysm should familarize themselves
with it.

“Germany and England, "" by J. A. Cramb

About the volume entitled “Germany
and England,” it*is only necessary to
quote what Field Marshal Lord Roberts
wrote to John Murray, the publisher: “I

Although our “college spirit’ is un-

But what about those of us who do go?
Can.we sit back and say that we at least
are doing our part? If we are really seri-
ous in our desire for more “college spirit”
we cannot be content with doing things
ourselves and letting others do as they

Dear Editors:

In reply to your correspondent who
speaks of the defects in the present sys-
tem of fire drills and suggests meanscof
remedying them, I wish to say that the
fire captains have been working out. an
entirely new system, which it is hoped
will remedy the defects mentioned and

~~ other weaknesses in-the-dritis-as-they-are

now run. The new system has been
worked out with great care and is based
upon the Wellesley system mentioned,
modified to suit the conditions at Bryn
Mawr. The new method of drills will be
begun very soon, and, it is hoped, will
prove as practical and satisfactory as the
one at Wellesley.

Dear Editors:

Although there has been much objec-
tion to the enforcement of the rule that
we should leave laboratory promptly at 4
o'clock, if we stop to consider, is that not
really a fair rule? It might be better
modified to read, that everyone shall
leave minor laboratory at 4 o’clock. In
major courses experiments take longer
and are often spoiled, if left, thus mean-
ing the loss of an afternoon’s work. How-
ever, the minor classes are so large that

,it is hard enough to keep them all work-

ing together, and it makes it all the
harder if a few particularly enterprising
or non-athletic people stay later than
four. There could be a modification again
in this case, that is, a student who wishes
to make up back work might be allowed
to remain. With these changes the rule
would stand as a good one.

THE COLLEGE NEWS



DIPLOMACY
|

Marie Doro, Blanche Bates and William |

Gillette come to town next week in a re-|
vival of Sardou’s play, “Diplomacy.” |
Semi-detective plots, involving diplomatic |
incidents and hinting at international do-|
ings, are always popular. We forget that
many of the devices have been “done to}
death” since the play first appeared, and, |
like children delighting in favorite stories
retold, we are enthusiastic over such in-|
cidents as the clever ruse wherewith the
English diplomat catches the villain,
Baron Stein, and the use of scent to track
down the villainess in the last act. Some
of the points are either not very logically
worked out or else not emphasized clearly
enough to “carry across the footlights.”
We can never, for example, explain satis-
factorily the return of the Baroness in
this last act. Why did she come? The
package, of course, was only a pretext.
We are never told, nor is there any sug-
gestion to aid us in imagining the reason
for ourselves.
. The acting does not quite fulfill ex-
pectations aroused «by the three lines
heading the cast. Marie Doro is disap-
pointing. She inclines to “rant” in the
emotional parts, William Gillette is the
very same Gillette of “Secret Service,”
ete.—Sherlock Holmes removed from
London to the legation in Paris. This
will, however, only please his admirers
and will not displease those who have
not seen him too often to tire of his man-
nerisms. Blanche Bates is excellent as
the ‘Baroness, the international spy, and
her handling of the big scene in the last
act-is-very effective. ;

On the whole, “Diplomacy” will give
you a very interesting Saturday afternoon
and prove a pleasant relief from quizzes,
orals and their like.

A “GOODWILL CHRISTMAS”

A “Goodwill Christmas,” as it has been
started by several alumne and others,
simplifies Christmas giving in order to
give more to relieve the unprecedented
suffering caused by the war. To help
meet this need seems more truly like
Christmas than much of our Christmas
giving. Perhaps some of us at College
could adopt the idea and reduce our ex-
tensive Christmas expenditures, thereby
saving a little extra money to swell our
Bryn Mawr funds for the Red Cross and
refugees.

SURPRISINGLY GOOD FOOTBALL -
PLAYED AT BRYN MAWR

The Odd Class team won the football
game from the Even Class team with a
score of 6-0. The umpire said that the
tackling was fearless and that some of
the téam play and’ signaling was really
good. “The Evens,” he said, “had some
good, tricky plays, although quick, they
weren't always quick enough, and they
made a pretty forward pass: The Odd
backs were a little slow. Both teams
were better on the defensive than on the
offensive, but of course that was due to
their inexperience.” In conclusion, he
said they certainly played surprisingly
good football.

The support of the side lines was very
spirited. Red roses and violets, red and
green and blue arm bands and peanuts
were sold. M. Scattergood, ‘17, L. Chase,

17, cheerleaders for the Odds; H. Chase,
‘16, L. Goodnow,/'16, and E. Houghton;
18, the Even cheerleaders, walked up
and down, encouraging, the shouts of the
spectators. The proceeds, over $20, goes

are:

organised svstem for fire drills. Fire
drills ought no longer to be a “bore” or
a “farce.” They lead to great financial
openings. A Bryn Mawr graduate may, if

at $300, but attendance at fire drills and
skill” in handling a hose may raise her

more plainly than the results of a com-
parison between them and the written
accounts in the “London Times’—or any

boundless in its dramatic power; superb
in its absolute unartificiality: pomp and
play have gone under along with better
things. The timely weeklies present the
best features: the “Illustrated London

After considering the editorial on Minor’
Latin in “The College News” of several
weeks ago, another practical idea oc-
curred to me. The writer wishes to em-
phasize the value of Minor Latin in teach-
ing English Composition. In fact in Har-
vard’s elective equivalent to our Second
Year English Composition a translation
once a week counts as a theme.

But the Editor omits, I think, an even
more practical value to the Bryn Mawr.
undérgraduate. If the Latin were trans-
lated more carefully and into better Eng-
lish, it would prove a great aid to the
Seniors in passing their Orals. For we
know from the Statistics of the first
Orals this year, that only five in French
and the same number in German, failed
who had had Major Latin. There is no
doubt*that training in speed and accuracy
of translation could at least partially be
attained in the present small divisions in
| Minor Latin.

Will not our American Art, Architec-

ried on in Europe of art treasures that
_are. the property_not only of_ the coun-
tries where they are, but also of the civi-
lized world? And will not Bryn Mawr
lead in such a protest? Germany dreads
the unfavorable public opinion of the
United States, and England and France
would. certainly gladly join in any meas-
ures Germany could be got to agree to -
for the protection of art monuments.

If such a protest were too late to save °
the art treasures of Belgium still remain-

late to protect Venice whose peril will be
great as soon as Italy moves and as she
certainly will move before long.

Madam:

A college woman in an audience al-
ways takes off her hat. We have been
brought up to consider this as like to the
laws of the Medes and Persians. Yet at
Chapel the other Sunday night my view
of the preacher was entirely eclipsed by
the mortar board in front of me. Out-
side visitors in my neighborhood seemed
also inconvenienced by the rows of tall
caps before them. The wearing of cap
and gown to college affairs is no doubt
impressive. But would it not be possible
to remove the cap before the sermon?
The comfort of the audience at large
would not then be sacrificed to the dig-

fore five minutes after. If the door is

\not locked then, anyway the lecture has

commenced, or at least dozens of mas-
culine feet have to be walked over before
dozens of critical eyes to reach a seat.
How much less nerve racking a life this
is! It is rather difficult at first to avoid
the imputation of undue greediness for
the divine crumbs of that which is
power; but one learns not to jump at the
sound of the bell.
Thirdly, in the list of comforts, the
library made me gasp. Instead of loung-
ing comfortably in a leather upholstered
chair before a more or less cheerful fire,
at X one grows to be extremely
grateful for a mere vacant seat, hard
and uninviting, and in the evening
strains one’s eyes beneath ceiling lights.

PROFESSOR BAKEWELL. SPEAKS ON
NIETZSCHE BEFORE THE



The lecturer gave a very interesting ac-
count of Nietzsche’s doctrine, of its sup-
posed relation to the present war, and of

phy. He did not think that Nietzsche, or
any writer, could be made responsible for
the war,.or for Germany’s part ‘in. it.
There was indeed a group of writers in
Germany who in recent times had formu-
lated a warlike philosophy. Nietzsche
was one of these. Treitschke and
Nietzsche had had a low opinion of each
other, and had not co-operated. On the
other hand, Bernhardi’s well-known book
bore on its title page as a motto
|Nietzsche’s words: “War and” courage
'have done more great things than char-
ity.” This was significant of Nietzsche’s
influence. But these writers had in this
|matter expressed a general undercurrent
‘of feeling in Germany. The ideas ex-
| pressed by them had moreover been gen-
erally acted on by all countries in inter-
inational affairs in the past. e notable
‘thing was that the soto ruthless
aggression, though it might have been
| practiced by other countries, was in Ger- |

Nietzsche’s teaching,

tinuation of evolutionism. This idea had
been applied by English writers.
English had stopped short when they!
‘came to the problem of morals. They |
found in nature evidences of strife and |
struggle; but they held that in morals the |
‘processes of nature were being reversed
by the action of altruistic impulses. The |

| moral world was tending towards a state

of frictionless peace and adjustment. It
would end in undisturbed industrialism.

statement of the feeling in the mind of
more reflective militarists. “Its [war’s]
horrors are a cheap price to pay for res-
cue from the only alternative supposed, of
a world of clerks and teachers, of co-
education and zoophily, of ‘consumer’s
leagues’ and ‘associated charities,’ of in-
dustrialism unlimited and feminism una-

any more! Fie upon such a cattleyard of
a planet!” The lecturer thought, with
James, that the central essence of this
feeling was a: valuable part of man’s na-
ture.

Professor Bakewell said there could be
no question of accepting the Nietzschean
creed in its totality. But Nietzsche had
disturbed many who were “woefully at
ease in Zion.” He was at least a counter-
poison to sentimentalism. Taken in large
doses he might be fatal, but in smaller
doses he was an incomparable tonic.
Nietzsche was a prophet of the heroic
and valorous life, and as such his influ-
ence would continue both in and outside

The writer of. the “Billy Sunday” edi-

students who advertised Mr. Sunday’s
presence “was justified by the fact that.
the students did it on their own responsi-

jected.” But this very fact that the stu-
dents were entirely free agents in the mat-
ter prevents them from being regarded in
the least as representative of the College
sentiment. Their whole attitude was so
entirely personal that they can only be

considered enthusiasts about Sunday.
Why the attendance of the students at the
meeting should represent a “sanction” of
Sunday and his methods we fail to see.
It merely represents the interest and curi-

In your last issue you published a let-
ter which I felt was unjustly severe in
its attack on Bryn Mawr’s work in the
settlement movement. The writer appar-
ently did not know of our large interest
in philanthropic work and did not realize
that although we have no chapter in the
College Settlement Association, yet we

people and teach six classes a week at

191
ae ee |

of lack of interest in the association is
just.’ Our “apathy” is’ not ue, however,
to lack of interest in

part of the undergraduates, but to the or-
ganization of the C.S. A. The only repre-
sentation of the association in College is
the Settlement Committee under the
Christian Association whose chairman is
the so-called “elector” from the College.
The duty of the committee is to arrange
settlement classes (which have practi-
cally no connection with the C. S. A.);
and the committee has no way of finding
out who is interested in social work out-
side of those who volunteer to teach set-
tlement classes.

So we are, as a College, represented in
an association with which, as a College,
we have practically no connection and
about which we know little. Is it any
wonder we are apathetic? It seems to me
that we ought either to get out of the
College Settlement Association  alto-
gether or else start a chapter independent
of the Christian Association which would
take real interest in it.

But to get out of the association would
seem rather foolish because a great many
of us are interested in social work and the
College Settlement is especially designed
to give College educated girls a chance
to do efficient social work. Now why not
start a chapter next. year and let all those
interested enough in social work join it?
In this way we would accomplish the two
objects of membership in the association;
first, we would give future social work-
ers a connection with social workers
from almost all Eastern colleges in an
association which will enable them to do
the most efficient social work after col-
lege; and, second, we would raise either
by dues or entertainments a contribution
to the association. And it seems to me
that we have plenty of real interest in
social work to start such a chapter and
make it a success.

What do other people think about this?
I hope someone will give the committee
suggestions for next year.

To the Editor of “The College News”:

The “student who advertised Mr. Sun-
day’s presence in a church outside the
College gates” would like to state that
the Bryn Mawr students who attended Mr.
Sunday’s meeting did so as individuals,
and as such had the right to reserve
seats. This should not have “inevitably
coupled the name of the College with the
revival meeting’ any more than the at-
tendance of a number of students at a
play couples the name of Bryn Mawr
with a_ theatrical performance. of
course, there was a chance that the ma-
jority of the undergraduates would ob-
ject, although such an objection would
have appeared as an attempt to limit in-
dividual activities; but as the majority
attended the meeting the natural assump-
tion would be that they approved. How-
ever, had any opposition been voiced be-
fore Mr. Sunday’s address at the church,
all reservations might have been can-
celled.

Mr. Sunday needs no defence. The last-
ing results of his work speak for the man.
One-of our secular periodicals says, “His
campaign through the West and Middle
West can almost be’ traced by the ‘dry’
towns and cities in his wake.”

A professor of psychology, from one of
our oldest universities attended several
of the “tabernacle” meetings, and said
that what had impressed him most was
the entire lack of sensational emotional-
ism. Knowing the deplorable moral con-
dition of the undergraduates of Cornell
who are “rising by the power of their in-
tellects,” it seems hardly fitting for a
reputable woman's College to quote their.

Eleanor Houston Hill:

To the Editor of “The College News”:

A few weeks ago one of the editorials
in “The College News” suggested that the
new plan for the election of the Christian
Association Board be put into effect in
the other College associations. By this
plan the individual classes nominate a
certain number of people from which the
election is made. We say that the classes
do not know the members who will be in-
terested in the work for which they are
nominated, that the association as a
whole is better able to judge. Now we
have a chance to end these disputes: . the
Christian Association appointments will
be made within a week, and then the re-
sult of class nominations will be mani-
fested at least in its beginnings. Will the
class in the first place nominate people
whom the president of the Association
would not think of as possible board mem-
bers; will there be any new people inter-
ested in the Association or will the same
people who always do class work be nomi-
nated? Even if we take it for granted
that some of the class nominees will bring
fresh vigor and interest into the Associa-
tion, can we be sure that these people will
be elected in the end? These are questions
which may often occur to us and which
dissuade us from attempting such inno-
vations in all our associations; they can
only be answered, however, by experi-
ment and experience. If we are anxious
to have the associations led by the mem-
bers who are best fitted to do so; feeling
that at present an improvement in meth-
ods of finding people can be made, we
must watch with interest the new board
of the C. A., which has had the courage
to try a new thing which it hopes will
bring greater vigour and success to its
work in the College.

The Bryn Mawr Club in China exists—
little more can be said of it. The few
members live at such distances from one
another, and have their time so well occu-
pied, and are such poor correspondents
withal, that we cannot hope to accom-
plish much more than to let our Bryn
Mawr friends know we are here. A cir-
cular letter is now spreading information
about our activities and those of the
Bryn Mawrtyrs in Japan. It is inspiring
to feel how heartily we-seem to be in ac-
cord in our work. We wanted the best
that Bryn Mawr could give us, and we
want to carry that best to those among
whom we work, and as I look around me
here in Canton, I believe the spirit of
hungering and thirsting after the best in
life is being developed in the lives of
these young men and women.

The Canton Christian College began its
activity about 1900. No college depart-
ment was possible until a foundation had
been laid in thorough preparatory work.
The first eight years were given to estab-
lishing a ““Middle School,” the grade being
equivalent to a high school in the United
States. In course of time our Students’
Christian Association developed a _ pri-
mary school for us, and a year or two
later. a grammar school was opened,
which made it possible for a student to
take his entire school course here. We
have had Freshman and Sophomore
classes several times during the last few
years, and even one class in medicine;
but America beckons too enticingly and
65 of our students are to be found in
American colleges this year.

GYMNASIUM CONTEST Won BY THE

The Gymnasium Contest beitreen 1917
and 1918, on March 26th, which was at-
tended by nearly everyone connected with
the College, was very close and exciting.
Out of a possible 310 points, 1917 won 243,
and 1918, 232. The best work ‘was in the
wand drill and in the parallel bars, and
the only maximum number of points given
was received by 1918 for its “stunt.” An
improvement in the drill as a whole was
noted and ascribed to the extra practice
which the new cup for individual work
called forth. G. Bryant’s work on the
horse and on the bars did credit to her
class and to herself. The judges, Dr. R.
Tait McKenzie, of the University of Penn-

Grammar School, and Miss Elizabeth
Burchenal, Executive Secretary of the
Girls’ Branch of the Public School. Ath-

contest and were much interested in the

THE TROPHY CLUB AND THE
GREENHOUSE



In-commemoration of the twenty-fifth
anniversary of the building of the green-
house at Dalton Hall, the Trophy Club
is about to come into possession of a let-
ter written on March 22, 1894, by the first
President of the College, Dr. James BE.
Rhoads. This letter, of which a copy ap-
pears below, was written to acknowledge
the receipt of a communication from the
representatives of the donors handing
over the greenhouse to the Trustees of
the College.

The greenhouse was not an original

part_of Dalton Hall, but was built about
eighteen months later when the need be-
came apparent for such accommodation
for laboratory. material for the Minor
Class in Biology.
The funds for its erection came partly
from a special grant by the Alumnew As-
sociation and partly from private contri-
bution. A benefit entertainment was held
in the former gymnasium and loyally at-
tended by undergraduates and especially
by the Freshman Class held to make up
the necessary sum.

The letter is as follows:

President’s Office
Bryn Mawr College

Bryn Mawr, Pa., 3 Mo. 22, 1894.
To Harriet Randolph, Ph.D., Leah Goff,
A.B., and Thomas Hunt Morgan, Ph.D.
Dear Friends: It will give me special
satisfaction to lay your letter of the 21st
instant, touching the Greenhouse, before
the Board of Trustees, and in anticipation
of their action I desire to convey to you
my personal thanks for your zeal, liber-
ality and success in the planning and con-
struction of the Greenhouse.

Believe me yours very truly and grate-
fully,

People are singularly inconsiderate in
their behavior at College functions.
When a strange, uncontrollable impulse
comes over the happy group outside the
gallery door to push—they push. When
they see someone vainly trying to reach
the doors to open them—they push harder.
When the doors are opened at last, the
mad shove bears along young and old
with an irresistible force. The young
and fragile maidens who would be willing
to wait politely for others to go in are
borne helplessly off their feet, nearly
crushed in by the pressure on all sides,
and finally left breathless and exhausted
to pick out what seats they can. Can we
not cultivate more considerate behavior
at these gatherings atid banish this rude
custom of shoving?

To the Editor of the “College News”:
The writer of the anti-Sunday editorial
in a recent issue of the ‘‘News” seems to
have overlooked several facts which make
her objection particularly inapt. It is
assumed, a priori, that the editorial ex-
presses the opinion of the whole editorial
staff. Such being the case, those editors,
who not long ago expressed approval
and deep admiration of Mr. Sunday’s
work, and delight at the prospect of his
visit to the Bryn Mawr Presbyterian
Chureh, and those, who with perfect
readiness availed themselves of the “re-
served seats” that have been such a
disgrace to the College, stand now in a
most peculiar position. There was no
reason on the one hand for their ex-
pressing an opinion which they have
since shown themselves unwilling to
support, nor on the other hand for their
attending the meeting and occupying
their reserved seats at that “emotional”
revival of which they did not approve.
However, the fact remains that they did
both. In view of that fact there seems
to be no adequate excuse for.the stand
they have taken in the editorial column
of the “News.” gy 2. FT. 6.



To the Editor of “The College News”:

Why do people sit on the outside seat
in Chapel so that all the people coming in

seem wiser if the front rows and outside
seats were filled first. Also might it not
be better if those who come to meetings

elsewhere did not always sit with backs

It is with the greatest pleasure that I
have read Miss Arny’s energetic letter in
a recent issue of your paper.

Ever since my Freshman year I have
been in close touch with settlements—
part of the time as a resident settlement
worker—for five years as treasurer of the
College Settlements Association, and, al-
ways, when called upon to state the part
taken by my beloved Alma Mater in this
great uplift movement, I have been forced
to-hang my diminished head in shame.

Individual Bryn Mawr graduates have Yet

Helena Dudley (Class of '89, hats off!)

cessful effort that have made the Boston
College Settlement a tremendous power
for good. The New York College Settle-
ment has no friend more staunch than
Pauline Goldmark, '96. Alice Gannett’s,
""98, is a name to conjure with on the
East Side. Carola Woerishoffer’s chief
life interest was in a New York settle
ment, and the plans, made in memory of
her, for social education, are a hopeful
sign of the stirring of the right spirit.



We have plenty of brains and oii
of money in our undergraduate body and
in our alumne association to compare fa-
vorably with any college in these United

To the Editor of “The College News”:
Why have we quiet hours in the corri-
dor outside our doors when there are none
on the seat outside the window? If it is
disturbing to have talking, laughing and
singing outside a closed door, it is even
more so to have it directly outside an
open window. With the advent of warm
weather the memorial seat threatens to
become a serious nuisance, for girls feel
free there to talk and laugh as loudly as
they please and to practise singing at all
hours. We plead for “quiet hours on the

HO! GOOD SKATING!

To the Editors of “The College News”:
The impossible becomes possible. With
the Athletic Association’s determination
to raise at once $5,000 to repair the old
hockey ‘field and build a new one, the
undreamed-of becomes practical. Bryn
Mawr. College may skate from June to
June. Up to this time, Bryn Mawr stu-
dents have looked upon a good skating
day as an annual College event—some-
what like the Junior-Senior supper play—
long anticipated, ecstatically enjoyed and
quickly over. Skating at Bryn Mawr has
seldom occurred oftener than once a year.
This fact is chiefly due to the peculiar
arrangement of our skating pond, alias
“hockey field.” Our skating pond, like
no other pond in the country, that one
knows of, is heated by a “hot water”
system—the hot water pipes of the halls
of residence pass directly underneath it.
To be sure, one need never complain of
the. cold while skating on-such—a- pond,
for one could easily crack a bit of ice,
plunge one’s hands in and warm them at
the pipes below. But such a habit was
apt to spoil the skating and shorten one’s
day. Now the old pond becomes a thing
of the past; $5,000 will be raised by June
1st, and the new hockey field will greet
us in the fall. It may be flooded as soon
as we like, and Bryn Mawr may, if it
chooses, skate every day in the year. Of
course, we may miss the old heating ap-
paratus, but the little house to be built
beside the field will soon fill all needs.
Skaters may rest before its fire, enjoy
hot tea in June and iced tea in January,
warm their fingers over the logs, and re-
turn to the pond—to skate to their heart’s
content. Skating will become in fact, as
well as in name, a Bryn Mawr sport.

proud of. But most of the girls are rich.

THE INTERCOLLEGIATE BUREAU OF
OCCUPATIONS OF NEW YORK



To the Hditor of the ‘‘College News”:

The Intercollegiate Bureau of Occupa-
tions, at 130 East Twenty-Second Street,
New York, will have completed four
years of office experience in September,
1915. During that time the New York
alumnee associations of Barnard, Bryn
Mawr, Cornell, Mt. Holyoke, Radcliffe,
Smith, Vassar, Wellesley and Wells have
contributed largely to its support. For
the first year, 1911-1912, the associations
united in contributing a total amount of
about $4500 and for each succeeding year
the total subscription has averaged about
$3000. Many of the associations have al-
ready voted to contribute to the Bureau
for the year 1915-1916 the same amount
that they gave for 1914-15.

Benefits, bazaars, appropriations from
the association treasury and appeals to
individual members are among the meth-
ods employed by the different associations
for raising the money required. Begin-
ning with May, 1916, a new plan of or-
ganization is to go into effect, and the
directors of several associations are send-
ing to their members the foregoing ap-
peal, with a view to enlisting their in-
terest in the new plan and in the re-
sults already accomplished by the Bureau.

It was voted at a recent meeting of
the Board of Directors of the Bureau that.

ship to the present co-operating organiza-
tions, it is proposed to ask them each to
contribute an annual fee of $25, which
will entitle the association to one repre-
sentative on the Board of Directors. As
this annual fee is small, it may be taken
from the association treasury without
making an appeal for individual contribu-
tions. Individual contributions, in the

then be paid directly into the treasury
of the Bureau.

At least 2000 members are needed, in-
cluding not only the graduates of those
colleges whose co-operation made the
Bureau possible, but all who are in-
terested in its larger aims and broader
activities.

The fact should be made clear that
the Bureau registers, not only college
women, but four groups of workers who
are seeking employment in occupations
other than teaching:

(1) Holders of degrees from accredited
colleges.

(2) Women trained professionally or
technically, whether or not they may be
college graduates.

(3) Women with valuable experience
regardless of their training. _

(4) Candidates for positions in social
work, both men and women, who meet
certain requirements as to experience and
training.

Evidently, therefore, silts need not
be restricted to any one group, although
ifor the next few years, at least, the suc-
‘cess of the Bureau must depend largely
‘upon the support of college’ women in
New York.

Results already achieved and the
| promise they give of future usefulness,
‘amply justify further support. From
|September, 1911, to January 1, 1915, more
| than 7500 people have appealed to the
|Bureau for information, for vocational
‘counsel or for positions. Of these, 2650
‘have registered, of whom, 1021 are
‘alumne of the nine co-operating col-
‘leges. We have placed 1186 applicants in
positions. No charge is made to those
who do not actually register with the
Bureau. The earnings from registration
fees and commissions paid by those who
do register, obviously should not be ex-
pected to cover more than the actual
cost of the placement work. Thousands
of other women, besides those registered,
| have received information about technical
schools, civil service positions, other
agencies, fellowships and vocational op-
|portunities. The Bureau is constantly
enriching and classifying its store of in-
formation on these points, and the num-
ber of educated women depending upon
it for such facts increases month by
|month.
| The growth of the Bureau as a business
‘agency is shown in the fact that the
average monthly earnings from fees and
commissions have increased from $58 in
1911-12, to $143 in 1912-13, $350 in 1913-14,
and $469 in 1914-15. Calls from em-
ployers have steadily increased and even
during this winter of business depression,
December was the record month, and
| January was larger than December. The
total number of calls registered from
employers up to January 1, 1915, was
| 2575. The percentage of positions filled
|to positions registered has increased |"

careless proof-reading? Last week we)

besides, several mistakes in spelling. |

THE VASSAR ASSOCIATION



The students of Vassar are petitioning |

the faculty to let them abolish the pres-

ent “Students’ Association” and organ- |
ize instead “Vassar Association,” of

/which the faculty and staff will be mem-

bers as well as all the undergraduates |
who have been at Vassar at least a
semester. At present the duties of self
government, athletics, dramatics (par-
tially) and almost all undergraduate in-
terests are under contro! of the “Stu-

would be even more inclusive

of color and line inthe costuming. Against
the smooth, grey background of a highly
conventionalized temple, the red zig-zag
stripes of Iphigenia’s garments, the pink
parrot-like costumes of Thoas’ soldiers,
and the brilliant blues and greens of the
chorus, were a source of much amuse-
ment to the audience. This mirth-
arousing costuming rather detracted
from the dignity and tragic effect of
simple, statuesque acting and exquisite
words, so clearly enunciated that they

--could be heard throughout the whole

audience. Yet in spite of jarring ele-
ments, such scenes as the arrival of
Orestes and Pylades and the recogni-
tion scene between Iphigenia and
Orestes were impressive and moving.
The chorus was one of the most beauti-
ful features of the performance. The
music, prepared by Professor Smith of
the Yale Music Department, imitated as
closely as possible the ancient models.
The choral odes, sung by a perfectly
trairied chorus of women, were a series
of most effective Gregorian-like chants.
The whole production was, if surprising,
a most interesting entertainment. :

SWISS RED CROSS WORK

Miss Ella Riegel has been kind enough
to allow “The College News” to print a
letter received by her from Camille Eris-
mann, 1900, about the relief work that is
being carried on in Switzerland. Writing
from Geneva, Miss Erismann says:

“We still have daily arrivals of refu-
gees, four or five hundred at a time; they
stay here a short time and are sent on
into Savoy. During ten days in March,
what they call “les grands blessés,”
French and Germans passed through here
on their way home. The Swiss Red
Cross organized their reception at the
station, where food was served to them
in the train and gifts of fruit, chocolate
and tobacco were made in large quanti-
ties. They all seemed cheerful and happy
to be going home. The blind were the
only ones who seemed depressed; it is so
dreadful to think of their long existence
in the dark! Wight hundred Germans
were exchanged against. eighteen hundred
French, and it is very likely that others’
will be exchanged later on.

Work is still going on at the agency
for the prisoners, though we have less to
do now than in the autumn, for in the
fighting in the trenches fewer men disap-
pear or are made prisoners. But much is
being done in the way of sending food
and clothing to the soldiers in the Ger-
man concentration camps. The appeals
from the men are pitiful and many of
them, who live in the invaded districts of
northeastern France can receive nothing
from home and do not even know where
their families are.

Many people here and there send pack-
ages to these soldiers who are most grate-
ful for the least thing done for them.
The International Red Cross here sends
all parcels free of charge; sometimes, un-
fortunately, they do not reach their desti-
ination. Bread is one of the things they
|most asked for, and at one time so much
‘of it was sent that the Swiss government
\had to limit the amount sent in one pack-
age to two kilos, otherwise there would
not have been enough left in the country
for the need of the citizens. The sewing
at the French Red Cross societies for the
French hospitals has been going on all
winter and many large parcels of
sheets, pillow cases, shirts, drawers, etc.,
have found their way to the hospitals
either near the front or farther away,
where the convalescents are sent. The
Belgians have not been forgotten or the
Servians, and money or garments have
been sent to them. In spite of all this
work we feel that there is yet much to
do. On all sides work is ng on and
funds. are being collected tor the relief

of the many sufferers.’"

It seems not to have occurred to
anyone that in placing the new athletic
field, there was anything to be considered
but the size of the ground available. We
have not seen the plans, but we are told
that it will be necessary to remove the
trees in the hollow by the powerhouse.
Such a proceeding would mean a loss to
the college that could not be replaced.
Trees, and such trees as those especially,
are a great asset to the beauty of the
campus. Moreover, they screen the
powerhouse. Why tear them down and
then plant “a woods of our own” on the
other side of the lower athletic field?
Why not leave those trees and put the
new athletic field at the other end of the
old? Five Alumnae.

(Editor’s Note)—We publish this letter
as it gives us an opportunity to corréct a
common misunderstanding. When the
necessity for another field arose in 1910,
the Athletic Board was anxious to put it
“on the other side of the lower athletic
field.” This was impossible, according
to the original plans for laying out the
campus, made by the architect and the
landscape-gardener. Another proposal
was to place the third field just below
Radnor, next to the present upper-
field. This space had, however, been
reserved by the architects for the stu-
dents’. Building. The ground by the
powerhouse was, therefore, the only
space available. We understand that the
new field will be in such a position that
it will be unnecessary to sacrifice any
trees for it.

DEMONSTRATION OF THE MODEL
SCHOOL CHILDREN IN
EURYTHMICS



On Friday, May 8th, at 3 o’clock, a most
interesting demonstration of the work of
the Model School children in Burythmics
and Ear-training was given in the Gym-
nasium. The purpose of the work in
Eurythmics is to cultivate a very exact
understanding of music (values of notes,
rhythm, accent, phrasing, tempo, etc.),
and also to acquire the muscular control
necessary to realize the music in action.
The movements are at first very arbi-
trary, the steps representing the value of
the notes and the arms the measure.
When the pupil is able to express the
music by means of these arbitrary move-
ments, and her understanding of the
music is obvious, the motions may be
varied and expression becomes more
“plastic.”

The children, however, had hardly ar-
rived at the plastic stage, though some of
the exercises were very expressive, par-
ticularly those in which more than one
child took part. One of the most pleas-
ing was an exercise performed by two
‘children, hand in hand, one child walking
the theme of the music, the other the
counterpoint.

Many exercises require a great deal of
concentration. One of these is the exer-
cise of beating three-quarter time with
one arm, and four-quarter time with the
other, while marking five-quarter rhythm
with the feet.

The children, with their short garments
of yellow and green, and their bare arms
and legs, seemed to be participating more
in an esthetic than a gymnastic exercise.
In the Dalecroze system both gymnastic
and gsthetic elements are wonderfully
combined with mental exercise, The
work is so fascinating that it is not
fatiguing and requires such exact atten-
tion that self-consciousness is lost. It is



true preparation for self-expression.



1916 LANTERN

Cee

)

Mbiinge -coptepne, the. judgment- like

being a native,” according to Hillaire
‘Belloc, and an tion of the 1915
“Lantern” taking rise from the campus
cannot perhaps’ attain a cold judicial em-
inence. However, assuming and discount-
ing for our common weakness for “Idola
Specus,” we must rate the “Lantern” note-
worthy. To assemble within such narrow
limits such finished work as “An Apo-
logue,” “A Foreign Profile,” and the
“Sonnet in the Early Italian manner,” is
an achievement;. and almost the entire
collection manifests an artistic conscien-
tiousness crystallizing in a distinctness
of impression rare in a composite. ‘“Kar-
nak” and the translation of “Une Jeune
Fille” have caught elusive lights and fra-

grances and movements; the “Duchess”

is a delicate vignette; and the spirit of
freshness of “An Old Mare” triumphs
over some rather conventional phrasing.
As to the essays, we should welcome
more of the critic in the wholly entertain-
ing exhibit of “F. P. A.”; we delight in
the graceful intellectual frisking of the
“Gardner’s Wordsworth” and “Reductio
ad Absurdum,” wondering perhaps how
long it could be kept up; and we are
grateful for our engaging introduction to
the engaging “Paul.” In a day where
artistic disciplines have fallen somewhat

out of favor, it is satisfying to note that:

our academic anthology standardizes, for
the most part, above the bizarre and
obscure in matter, the capricious and
irregulated in form.

It is the habit of the carping critic,
when he can not lay hold upon anything
to wrench away, to search out the defect
of a quality and he might be led to say
that the “Lantern” had achieved its
freedom from crudity at the expénse of
something of vitality. I do not mean
that the technique of realism is wanting,
not one of the contributions fails of its
illusion; I am far from pleading for a
limitation of the world of the familiar;
and “A Rainy Day” is perhaps an object
lesson in the merits of photography per
se; I mean rather that the “Lantern”
contributions have not taken up the chal-
lenge of the world of sharper realities.
To illustrate, the stories are admirably
finished sketches in the comic, the pa-
thetic, and the strange; they refrain from
the deeper springs of human action that
give rise to conflict. The atmosphere of
the “Lantern” is serene, rarefied. That
is, of course, in one aspect as right as
it is natural; and further, to desire for
future “Lanterns” resistance to a “refined
and comely decadence” is not to wish
them to share in the modern current of
ugly realism of horrors. One’s wish is
with the forces of universal struggle.

PRESIDENT THOMAS SUMS UP THE
YEAR—NEW PLAN FOR DEBATING

At the last Chapel on May 26th, Presi-
dent Thomas gave a summary of the
events of the college year. She began
by saying that we should be very thank-
ful for the peace which permits us to
study as usual. She then outlined some
of the most significant things which have
happened during the college year, say-
ing:

The most truly important step forward
taken by the College has been the foun-
dation of the new Carola Woerishoffer
Department of Social Economy and So-
cial Research. Many social workers have
expressed to me their satisfaction that
Bryn Mawr is going to study these social
problems because, as they say, there are
now in the field many practical workers
and only a few trained leaders.

The interest taken by the undergrad-
uates during the past year in debating
gives promise of future su in public
speaking. Dr. Shearer tells m even
now she thinks that the unde uate
debating compares favourably with the
debating which she heard recently at Vas-
sar College. Debating is not only of
practical value but is a truly intellectual
sport. It teaches you to get what you



you Wish to ask the faculty
the help which

yeat and that in «

the College to provide two ae
coaches—a man trained in the formal
methods of debating and a woman of the
practical kind that has been developed
recently to teach young women suffra-
gists_ to speak effectively at street
corners from soap boxes. I shall be very
glad to offer a prize each year to the
best debater in the College and also a
debating shield or cup on which the
names of the winning class teams may be
inscribed year after year. When you
have material for a creditable Varsity
team there will, I think, be no objection
to your challenging other women’s col-
leges.

It is also of interest that during the
past year we have reached the conclusion
in many departments of study that it
will be wise to return next year to
our former five-hour-a-week system of
courses. We believe that your work will
gain in continuity and interest and that
the lessening of quizzes and final exam-
inations will give you mo me to think
and read in connection with your college
work.

The Graduate Administrative Com-
mittee which has been in operation this
year has seemed to solve a great many
of the difficulties and misunderstandings
between the Self-Government Association
as a whole, and the Graduate Association,
and will be made an integral part of the
Self-Government Association next year.

The faculty and undergraduate students
have also given a great deal of attention
throughout the year to the subject of
attendance at classes. We have all
agreed as to the end to be obtained, but
we have differed as to the best means
of attaining it. Our discussions have
aroused the amused and interested at-
tention of other colleges and have had
the result of making some of them con-
sider carefully the working of their
present attendance rules. I hope very
much that as a result of our agitation,
Bryn Mawr may be able to make a con-
tribution to this most important educa-
tional question.

The undergraduates are to be con-
gratulated on the “Lantern” which I have
just read in proof. It seems to me truly
literary and truly modern. Both the
poetry and the prose seem to me to show
that the College is on its way to develop-
ing a literary atmosphere of extreme
modernity but not on that account to be
found fault with because each literary
generation begins by outraging the prej-
udices of the former literary generation.

It looks as if the Athletic Association,
which is another name for the whole
College—as I think that all the under-
graduates belong to it, would give us a
commencement gift of a new athletic
field and skating pond and new tennis
courts. I am told by the President of the
Athletic Association that $4100 has al-
ready been subscribed and that the
Athletic Board believes that the full sub-
scription of $5000 will be obtained by
commencement. It will mean a great
deal for the general health and exercise
of the undergraduates to have enough
fields for all the class teams to exercise
on and to have a good skating pond for
the whole College. The Athletic Asso-
ciation is warmly to be congratulated,
and the sincere thanks of the College are
due to the undergraduate classes for their
large class subscriptions and to the
many alumne and friends who have
helped them.

SINGING AT VASSAR



At Vassar each class has its own steps
where the girls assemble every clear
night in the spring and fall. Sometimes
there is, instead, college singing when all
the classes get together about the Senior

For the past year I have read in your
correspondence column letters containing
excellent ideas and suggestions; but, to
my surprise, I have found that these
letters are for the most part unsigned,
or else signed with such frivolous
and fictitious names as “A. Tentive,” or
“I Deal.” Why is it that the writers so
obstinately refuse to sign their real
names? Surely they cannot be ashamed
of their ideas, for that would be contrary
to the principles of self-confidence and in-
dependence which the modern college
woman is supposed to represent. Might
I suggest that there is no reason why the
College should be kept in the dark as to
the authors of these letters. The sugges-
tions are in themselves excellent, and
there is a tang of mystery about them
that is not unpleasing to us, contempora-
ries of Sherlock Holmes. But is it not
taxing the reader’s versatility a little to
much to ask him to take seriously a sug-
gestion offered by A. Tentive or I. Deal?
Would not the suggestions have more
force and purpose if they seemed to come
from a fellow being ,a person of flesh
and blood, rather than a fantastic no-
body? I appeal to the readers of “The
News,” would not this humble suggestion
of mine carry more force and be more
interesting to them if I had signed my
real name to it instead of merely

Busy Body?



To the Editor of “The College News”:
What is the French Club? In the “Lan-

its interests are mysteriously discussed.
Yet in the Christian Association Hand-
Book and in the list of clubs which you
published last week no mention is made

their “entente” with the French lan-
guage? Who is the “outsider” who may

CHRISTIAN ‘ASSOCIATION RECEP-
TION TO THE ENTERING
STUDENTS.



President Thomas Thanked for Removal
of the Cut-Rule

President Thomas received with the

Christian Association Board at the recep-

tion for the entering students on Satur-
day night. In the receiving line with her
were Dr. and Mrs. Barton, Miss Applebee,
Agnes Smith, Margaret Russell, Mary
Branson, Adeline Werner, and the officers
of the Christian Association.

In welcoming the students, President |

Thomas spoke of the need of a Christian
Union in every large community, and of
the importance of making religion tell in
the daily life of the students. In this con-
nection she spoke of the differences she
had observed between religious sincerity
in America and Japan. She stressed the
fact that owing to the lack of Christianity
in Japan, religious feeling there seemed
impersonal and insincere.

Miss Russell, speaking for the Self-
Government Association, pointed out the
fact that self-government meant the gov-
ernment of each student, not by herself
alone, but by the opinion of the majority.

The College was like a German battle-
field during the canipaign for hockey ter-
ritory last year, according to Miss Bran-
son, who described the Athletic Associa-
tion. The generals led their forces so
successfully along the class fronts that
now the College is able to colonize the
territory with the Class of 1919.

Miss Barnicle spoke of the Graduate
Club as the “summum bonum” in the life
of every graduate student.

Miss Werner spoke of the importance
of the Undergraduate Association, defin-
ing its purpose as that of “arousing an in-
terest in the academic phase of student
life, and maintaining the high standard of
scholarship set by the authorities.” She
pointed out that in the Undergraduate As-
sociation, “questions affecting academic
phases of student life can be discussed by
all the students, and brought to the notice
of the faculty.” Miss Werner closed her
speech by saying:

“It is my wish this evening, in behalf
of the Undergraduate Association, to
thank President Thomas, the trustees,
and the members of the faculty, again for
the generous consideration they gave the
several petitions sent them by the Un-
dergraduate Association, and for the
present system regulating attendance. I
wish, furthermore, to assure President
Thomas that we, as the Undergraduate
Association, will do all in our power cor-
dially and continually to co-operate with
the President and the faculty in making
the present system a success, and that
we, as an association, will try to justify
the trust and confidence placed in us by
the authorities of the College.”

Miss Applebee’s speech dealt with the
unfortunate necessity of President’s hav-
ing to make their associations “fool
proof,” a necessity sometimes brought
about by the lack of thought of the
members.

Last of all, Miss Smith spoke of the
Christian Association, telling of its broad
basis, which gives an opportunity for all
to supply their fundamental needs of re-
ligious work and thought. The reception
closed with College songs, led by D. De-
neen. .

In reply to the numerous inquiries
about the French Club, I wish to say
that it has been the custom for many
years for the president for the current
year to choose the president for the com-
ing year. Thus the presidency has been
handed down, each year to that member
of the club considered most competent to
fill the position for the coming year.

The French Club has no charter. It
has been customary for the president to
hold an initiation each year to which she
invited all students whom she considered
to have the ability to speak fluent French.
From this group she selected those who
spoke the best and were willing to speak
at the meetings. The club has not been
formed to allow the members of majo
and post major classes to improve their
accents or to learn to speak French. It
has been formed to give to those who
already speak good French an opportun-
ity to meet and discuss topics of current
interest. The club is not a training class
for faltering speakers; it does not wish
for its members those who have obtained
high grades in French classes but who
for the most part cannot speak fluent
French.

It will be formed along the customary
lines this year, and no one who is not
able and willing to speak fluent French
will be admitted.

Self-Government Spirit

To the Editor of “The College News”:

The following extract from a letter
written by a former President to the Stu-
dent Government Association of another
college for women at the opening of the
year seems to me to state the case so
excellently that I venture to send it to
“The News” for the members of our
Bryn Mawr Association to read:

“You wouldn’t want any other kind of
government than student government—
and yet you can never have student gov-
ernment—that is, self-government, until
every one of you pitches in with all her
might and main to make it. And don’t
think you’re giving up your own pleasure
for a set of red-tape rules that nearly give
you brain fever when you first read them;
you're really making everything happier
and safer for yourself and your neighbor.
And if you came to college expecting ta,
get big ideals and to mold your character
into the best sort of person you were ever
meant to be, then here’s one of the big-
gest ideals in the wide world, masquerad-
ing under loyalty to an association, an
Executive Board and a book of rules—it’s

RL. Fashions



the true Christian ideal of learning to |
live not for your own convenience, but |
for the convenience and progress of the
whole community where you are. If)
you're able to see just that thing, and to |
say once in a while, “I could do that thing |
alone, but we can’t all do it, so I won't |
do it,” then I’m not worried about the
prospect of a Student Government run

by a few faithful souls who have seen the SMART HATS SUITABLE FOR |

vision, and evaded by everybody else.

In view .of | But you must all promise to do that, or it |

won't work—and, oh, it must work. Stu-|
dent Government can't fail at this stage,
because it has too many loyal hearts back |
of it, and too many willing hands have
worked hard for it during all its exist-

Processional at Chapel.

To the Editor of “The College News”:

In reply to the letter of last week con-
cerning the processional of the choir at
Sunday evening Chapel, I would like to
explain how the plan of a processional
originated, and thus to show how free
from any spirit of denominationalism this
plan is: The plan was suggested by the
Christian Association service at Welles-
ley College, in which the choir uses both
processional and recessional not only on
Sunday evenings but also at the twenty
minute daily chapel. The service at
Wellesley is on the order of the Bryn
Mawr service and is intended to be en-
tirely undenominational. Therefore, when
the processional was introduced at Bryn
Mawr it was not with any idea of denomi-
nationalism, but rather with the purpose
of adding to the service what Wellesley
possessed and what Bryn Mawr lacked—
a real beginning and an emphatic distinc-
tion between a religious service and a lec-
ture. We are sorry that this purpose
should have been misunderstood by any-
one.

I wish to say also that the C. A. Board
should not be criticized for the introduc-

tion of the processional, as the board was |

in no way responsible for it. The idea
was entirely that of the choir and was
carried through wholly by them. The

choir consists of members of the Presby- |

terian, Episcopal, Congregational, Uni-
tarian, Baptist and Dutch Reformed de-
nominations, all of whom approved the
idea of the processional.
Katherine W. McCollin,
Choir Leader.

To the Editor of “The College News’”’:

A great majority of the undergraduates |
look upon the new plan in Sunday even- |
ing Chapel of having the first hymn sung |
as a processional for the choir as a satis- |

factory change. The plan is one that has
been in use before this in many schools
and colleges, regardless of denomination.
Moreover it is no longer a ceremony used
exclusively in the Episcopal and Roman
Catholic churches, as it has been adopted
by communities consisting of people more
broad-minded than she who signs herself
“Disturbed.” It is hard to understand
how any one can be so narrow-minded
that one can be kept away from Chapel
because of the superficial change in the
service, which is not to our liking. Is it
for the mere form of worship that we go

| to Chapel, or for the sake of worship it-
| self?

Cheering Spontaneous
To the Editor of “The College News”:

In last week’s number of “The News”
someone suggested that the loud cheer-
ing of the different classes is not due to
a genuine feeling of enthusiasm, but that
each class must “cultivate an expression
of ecstasy to be assumed” when its
Juniors’ song is sung. It seems to us that
this person has failed to join in the feel-
ing of her class towards their Juniors.
To us this cheering is a genuine, spon-
taneous expression of loyalty to our sister
: due to an appreciation of the fellow
feeling with which that-class has backed
us in all our undertakings. What other
form, may we ask this creature of sensi-

‘ tive nerves, may this expression take?

Enthusiastic



Does the writer of the letter published

‘in the last week’s “News”, objecting to |
the choir’s singing the first hymn of Sun- |
day evening Chapel as a _ procéssional

realize the reason this was adopted?
There is no symbolic idea about it; it is
merely to make a more definite and dig-

nified beginning to our Sunday evening |

service which too many people attend
simply as a lecture. As to its being out
of keeping with the rest of the service,
I can only say, it is certainly no more
Episcopal or Catholic than are our fixed
prayers, which have long been used and
which most of us would hate to see given
up, It seems to me that to consider so
slight a change of custom of service, with
so good a reason for being, a reason
| for staying away from Chapel, is a bit
childish. A Unitarian.

In the last issue of “‘The News” I was
astonished to see the attitude which an
alumna took-toward the measures which
the present undergraduate body is taking.
We regret exceedingly that she should
feel that in our actions we are casting
any reflections on the undergraduates in
College before our day, yet we feel that
it is our privilege as the Undergraduate
Association to adjust circumstances and
to settle matters to suit present-day
needs.

As to considering the Advisory Board
a brilliant innovation, this does certainly
not seem to have been the attitude of
“The College News” for December 17th,
1914, which states that “the question of
an Advisory Board to take the place of
the old board, composed of the Student
Council and the officers of the Associa-
tion, will also come before the meeting”.
This action was necessitated because the
Student Council had been abolished and
with it the Advisory Board, since the
Student Council was the Advisory Board.

This year, I believe, the Advisory Board
was spoken of in your columns as an ex-
cellent innovation and I do not feel that a
grave error was committed by this state-
ment. The board is an innovation in the
sense that it is now a truly active factor
in the Association. To-day no meeting
of the Association is called without
having first consulted the board to ar-
range the business beforehand. The Ad-
visory Board has existed up to this time,
it seems, purely nominally, for in the
President’s report for the year 1912-1913
no mention is made of it, and in her re-
port for 1913-1914 the President writes:
“The Students’ Council has not been used
as an Advisory Board at all this year”. It |
was not until last year that the board
really became an active part of the As-
sociation. I feel that in this sense it can |
be called an excellent innovation.

Then, too, I should like to say a word |
about the present system upon which |
Lost and Found is run. In former years, |
it is quite true, that the President of the |
Undergraduate Association co-operated
with the Dean in making Lost and Found |
appointments and the office guaranteed |
to pay any deficit. This plan seemed to |
have been lost sight of some time ago, |
for Dean Reilly telis me that for several |
years past, as far as she knows, no defi- |
nite arrangement has been made with the
office in regard to the Lost and Found |
deficit. Last year, when the deficit oc- |
curred, quite ignorant of the fact that the |
office in former years had guaranteed the |
salaries, each undergraduate was as-
sessed three cents to make up the
amount, This year, as you stated in your |
columns, “to assure a_ better business |
foundation”, it was voted that the Asso-



| ciation pay the salaries directly and that

the proceeds from Lost and Found be put |
in the treasury of.the Association. The |
needs of the situation, we felt, demanded
such an action. That the former under-
graduates were “unbusinesslike and |
thoughtless” was certainly not the mo- |
tive which prompted us to take this ac- |
tion, and we really regret that an alumna |
of Bryn Mawr should take our actions as
such, :

That the Bulletin Board Committee is |
not new is indeed quite true and that |
such a mistake should have occurred in
your columns is to be regretted, but we |
felt at the time that the matter was of
such slight importance that it was not |
necessary to rectify it.

In conclusion, I should like to say that |
the spirit in which this letter is written
is not one adverse to alumne criticism;
in fact, such criticism is what we need.
If only more alumne would show the |
present undergraduate body where they
feel we are wrong, I am sure that we, asa
body, would appreciate any such criticism |
and suggestions, and that we, in our turn, |

House on Christian Street is of especial | will be only too glad to explain any of |

interest: to Bryn Mawr as we have sent | our actions in undergraduate matters.

In an editorial published in “The
News” of November 11th, the Board ex-
pressed its determination to change the
tone of its criticisms of plays this year.
Heretofore something has been found in
all the plays to praise, and the unpraise-
worthy has—usually been lightly passed
over, or as has usually been the case, has
been omitted entirely in the write-up lest
someone's feelings should be hurt. This
year, as I have gathered from the above
mentioned editorial, ‘The News” intends
to criticize plays for their true value, “to |
weigh the good qualities and the bad so
that we may give a fair estimate of the
whole.” Surely “The News” is to be)
commended for this determination. But
I would suggest if the two recent play |

write-ups are samples of the result of |
add a|
dramatic critic to its staff, or at least use|
a little more discrimination and good |

this intention, that “The News”

judgment in its criticisms.

The write-up of Banner Show was, on
the whole, good. A very glaring tech-
nical fault, however, was committed in
the amount of space taken up in ad-
versely criticizing the plot. In the first
place, a Banner Show is not supposed to

have any plot, and in the second place, |

whatever difficulty there might have been

in following the none too definite actions |
of the players, was clearly explained in |

the programs. The critic very obviously
had not read a program.
But in the write-up of the Sophomore

Play, it seems to me the critic showed |
neither dramatic intelligence nor a sense |

of proportion. She neither praised what
was good nor condemned what was not
good. In all opinions but that of “The
News” it was Virginia Kneeland to whom
the palm belonged. Hers was the one
piece of brilliant acting in the play. She
showed a thorough intelligence in and
-@asy adaptation to, a very difficult part.

Her personality was dominating and she |

held the stage every minute she was on
it. Yet our critic gave her a brief half

sentence and said she “cleverly portrayed
her part”.

less‘ good, and many of whose scenes
dragged for lack of spontaneity, she de-
voted a whole paragraph of eulogy. To
say that F. Richmond was “one of the
most amusing characters in the play”,
tells absolutely nothing. Would it not be
fairer to mention the intelligence she
showed in acting, and the comedy she got
out of a part entirely unsuited to her?
Mary Allen was not mentioned and I have
as yet found no one who does not agree
that she was the best and most comic of
the students. Nor was notice taken of
the careless enunciation of many of the
actors and the general slowness in pick-
ing up cues.

As far as the undergraduates are con-
cerned, a correct or false criticism of a
play can make no material difference, for
everyone who sees the plays forms her
own opinion. But for the alumne and
others whose only idea of plays given
here at College is obtained from write-ups
in “The College News”, should not “The
News” attempt to give the general opin-
ion of the College as a whole rather than
the personal opinion of a few editors, es-
pecially when that opinion, as in this last
case, has proved so inadequate?

Helen Marie Harris, ‘17.



To the Editor of “The College News”:
Is interest in hockey lacking this year
or has the intelligence of “The News”
reporters failed them? Or how else can
we account for the sudden slump in the
reports of hockey games? Last year you
gave us snappy pointed accounts of the
games and criticisms of the players. They
were written with a vim and an enthu-
siasm that showed that the reporter en-
joyed hockey and had an accurate knowl-
edge of the game. Compare with these
the lukewarm, spiritless, vague, articles
in the recent numbers of “The News”.
How vividly illuminating is this: “The
ball continually went up the field and
down again”, (vol. 2, No. 9), or again:
“Most of the goals were made by the
forwards following into the goal’, (how
extraordinary!). In flashes of inspira- |
tion the reporters say three distinct |
times in one article that no goal was
made. Now “we hold these truths to

Two girls were standing by the de-
pleted umbrella stand in Taylor, looking
ruefully at the torrents of rain outside.

“Let’s write a letter to ‘The News‘
about it”!

“Oh, they’d think we cared about losing
the’silly umbrellas, and it’s just the prin-
ciple of the thing”.

Now I have never lost an umbrella (I
never had one), and I feel that I can write
on behalf of those who care only for “the
principle of the thing’, but must refrain
from expressing their rage because of
personal loss. An umbrella has, of
course, an impersonal appearance, but it
is not community property. However, I
am not wishing to attack those who “ac-
quire” an umbrella, and, forgetting in the
course of time that theirs was one with
a knobby brown handle, continue placidly
to use one with a straight black handle.
That implies carelessness, of course, and
perhaps a failing mind, but it does not in-
volve any moral delinquency. And the
“loss” of an umbrella, once for all,
arouses only mild indignation and regret
on the part of the original owner.

But there is a righteous indignation
which can hardly be excessive at the de-
pravity and temerity of the “borrower”
who can take an umbrella from the stand
in Taylor in the midst of the downpour,
and return it to the exact spot the next
day, for the owner to find, when, as she
opens Taylor door, the umbrella stand is
bathed in a flood of sunshine!

True Sport in Question
To the Editor of “‘The College News’’:

While people are busy complaining
of the lack of college spirit here at Bryn
Mawr in proportion to the abundance of
class-spirit, I wonder if it has ever oc-
curred to them how unnecessary and
even harmful much of this so-called class-
spirit is. Far be it from anyone, espect-
ally an undergraduate, to criticize true
class-spirit, that indefinable something
that holds seventy or more girls together
with a common purpose, that puts the
germ of success in a class play, or that
gives the punch in the final rally to win
a hockey game. But when class-spirit
has gone so far, and instances are all too
many, that the opposing teams actually
hate each other, and one’s nerves are
stretched to the breaking point in terror
lest the rival class banner will hang

I would like to call the attention of
those students who believe there is no
College spirit at Bryn Mawr to a few
facts. When last spring, as every one
knows, the three hundred and sixty stu-
dents raised, within a month, over four
thousand dollars, and the Alumnzw gave
about a thousand, in order to build a new
hockey field and,some new tennis courts,
here is an example of generous giving for
the sake of the College. The Varsity
games also were supported with great
enthusiasm. this year and the players
themselves were ready to fight to the end
for Bryn Mawr. A final example of Col-
lege spirit is the strong desire of the stu-
dents to erect a students’ building as a
memorial to Miss Garrett. This shows
that they want a place where they may
meet, without respect to their classes or
halls, as a united body of Bryn Mawr stu-
dents.

MR. KING’S PROGRAM HAMLET



Recital Makes $155 for Polish Relief Fund



On Friday evening Mr. Samuel Arthur
King gave a Shakespearean recital for
the Benefit of the Polish Relief Fund.
The program was entirely made up of
scenes from ‘Hamlet’. An encore was
given at the end of the evening, Mercu-
tio’s description of Queen Mab, from
“Romeo and Juliet”.

Mr. King began with the court scene
in which Hamlet plans to go to Witten-
berg and the queen begs him to stay;
next, the scene on the ramparts with the
ghost, and the great soliloquy at the end
of Act II. In the scene with Ophelia,
where Polonius and the king are hidden,
Mr. King said that he followed Edmund
Keane’s tradition, in which Hamlet is
supposed to know that the king is behind
the curtain. He also quoted Coleridge to
support this interpretation.

Persons Skillfully Distinguished

Mr. King next gave Hamlet’s advice to
the players, and then the entire play
scene, where the distinction between the
persons speaking was skillfully made.
Act III, Scene 3, where Hamlet chides his
mother, and his father’s ghost appears,
came next, and finally the graveyard
scene, with Laertes’ lament over the body
of Orphelia.

S. H. ATHERTON, '13, MAKES
NOTABLE REPORT ON GIRLS
IN INDUSTRY



The report on the conditions among the
young working girls of Wilkes-Barre, Pa.,
which has just been published by the Na-
tional Consumers’ League of New York,
was made by Sarah H. Atherton, ‘13. Miss
Atherton’s survey is not the usual dreary
compilation of facts, but, according to all
those who have read it at first hand, it is
an exceedingly human document. The
object of the report is to present the facts
in the lives of girls from 14 to 16 years
of age, who come from working homes in
the coal regions and have left school to
make money by their own efforts.

It was found that 79 per cent of the
girls gave all they earned to the family.
Only 9 per cent kept all their pay. Of
281 girls there were but 7 who worked
for pin-money or pretty clothes.

Music and Movies Favorite Amusements

In giving their favorite amusements,
the majority preferred moving pictures or

music, Reading held third place; church,
theatre, and Y. W. C. A. came fourth; and
‘outdoor spofts were last. “Talking” was

I should be glad if you would allow me
to correct the mistaken impression of my
opinion unintentionally given by the par-
agraph in “The College News” of Janu-
ary 20th under the heading, “Courses to
be Lightened”. Numerous readers have
feared from this notice that I as president
of the college wished to lower the college
standard of academic work whereas the
precise contrary is the case. I asked the
Advisory Board of the Undergraduate As-
sociation to confer with Dean Reilly and
me because we feared that, if it was true,
as stated by many students, that the
quantity of required reading in certain
courses was too great to be done without
serious overwork, the quality of work
in these courses could not be maintained,
and thought that it should be brought to



the attention of the instructors concerned,
Dean Maddison ans as = of the

‘| conference, L
The Advisory Board had made a -_

uable study of the hours given to College
work by almost every student belonging
to the four undergraduate classes, and
had reached the conclusion that many
members of the three lower undergradu-
ate classes were spending too many hours
weekly over their studies. The question
whether this was because of the intrinsic
difficulty of the work or because of lack
of knowledge of how to study econom-
ically was more difficult to determine.
The statement made in the article in
“The News”, which reads, “President
Thomas proposed to have the work in
these courses (about one-half the courses
in the college, as stated in the preceding
paragraph) cut down” has with justice
given rise to serious misunderstanding.
The result of our very informal confer-
ence was, as I understood it, that after
the Advisory Board had submitted defi-
nite statements of the number of pages
required in connection with certain read-
ing courses and the amount of outside
preparation, including problems and
make-up laboratory experiftnents, required
in connection with certain scientific
courses, I said that I should be very glad
to talk over these statements with the
instructors giving the courses in question,
and I promised especially to ask them to
correct the impression of the undergrad-
uates that as much work had been re-
quired last semester in the five hour sem-
ester blocks as in the corresponding three
hour courses given throughout last year.
I further stated that I thought that a
44 hour working week was a very good
average for Bryn Mawr undergraduates
and that if this were adhered to in the
main for the majority of the class it
seemed to me to permit those who
worked more slowly to exceed it without
breaking down and those who worked
more rapidly to gain time for outside
reading over and above what was defi-
nitely required. I endeavoured to guard
this statement carefully so as not in any
way to implicate other members of the
faculty. I remember taking care to say
that I had not discussed the matter with
any one and that it was only my own in-
dividual opinion.

In_conclusion, I should like to remind
the editors of “The College News” of
their promise, which I think might well
be extended to other members of the fac-
ulty, not to quote me without showing me
in proof what they may think that I have
said.

MAN AND MACHINERY



Mr. Birckhead Speaks in Chapel



“The one thing which stands out su-
premely at the present moment in the
life of the world is machinery,” said Mr.
Hugh Birckhead, in his sermon Sunday
night. He spoke of the great difficulty
which the modern world must cope with
in subduing the great power and influence
of mechanism, or, as he called it, “the
heartless will of the machine”. He says:
“We have placed in our mechanisms a

will, and this will working itself out is a)

very real and definite part of that mech-
ism”. Mr. Birckhead holds that ma-
chinery does not divide gains fairly,
because it does not care. “It is the
spite of the machine. We call this
phase of it industrialism, and across
the water we call another phase of it
militarism.” At present machinery domi-
nates the world, says Mr. Birckhead, and
a country is successful only in so far as
it is able to co-operate with and bend its
will to this mechanical power. But, he
says, “I think this great machinery which
threatens us now will soon become our
servant. We must put it in its place, we
must call it by its name, and then at last
it will stand at the throne of God with
the other beasts, great companions of sal-
vation for all”.

In reply to the “Skating Enthusiasts’”
“College News” of January
| 24th, I should like to submit the following
facts: —

1. Since January 12th we have had
skating on the following days, which are
as nearly continuous as weather condi-
tions have permitted: January 12, 13
(14th Sunday), 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 (storm
21st, Sunday 22nd), 25, 26, 27. The skat-
| ing has also been as good as it has been
| possible to make it and every attention

(The editors do not hold themselves responsible | has been given to it by the Superintend-

for opinions expressed in this column)
To the Editor of the “College News”:

Among the punishments
cruel and unnecessary is that inflicted on
the Danaids, who, for their sins, had to
pour water in a sieve. But at least they
had sinned and they did not have to pay |
for the water. The Danaids who manage

accounted |

lent of Buildings and Grounds and the
| men under him.

2. The Athletic Board had given no di-
irections as to how or when the field
|should be flooded when the “Skating En-
| thusiasts’ "" letter was written. The first
| decision of this kind was made on Satur-
| aay. January 27th, after I had written to



EGE NEWS

the Outdoor Manager of the Athletic As-
sociation and asked the wishes of the
Athletic Board in this respect. _

-| 3, The most inexdct statement in the



carelessness and stupidity are displayed”.
I understand that the Athletic Associa-
tion fee for skating is $1.00. Is it not
rather “careless” for those who have had
the opportunity. of skating eleven (11)
times for $1.00 to assume that they can
skate indefinitely for that sum; and is it
not rather “stupid” for them to make no
effort to learn the reasons for the condi-
tions they criticise? It costs the Athletic
Association a goodly sum for an artificial
skating pond, so when we found that it
was exceedingly expensive to flood the
surface of the field after 10 p. m., once
only we tried flooding it at 6 a.m. We
had observed that on two-thirds of the
days since skating started it was colder
at 6 a. m. than at midnight and we knew
that there was not likely to be more wind
in the early morning than at night. Our
experiment, in our opinion, was a great
success, for the cost of the early morning
flooding was exactly one-fourth of the
cost of flooding at midnight and the field
was ready for skating at eleven (11) a. m.
(and not only in the afternoon”, as stated
in the letter).

- I wish to assure the readers of the Col-
lege News that every effort is made to
provide skating under the adverse condi-
tions of the Bryn Mawr climate in which
the thermometer goes up and down daily
with astonishing rapidity. There never
has been perfect skating at Bryn Mawr
and, in my opinion, there never will be.
We can only do the best we can. We ask
for a little of the faith shown in the Busi-
ness Office one sunny day last summer.
It was 96° in the shade when a member of
the College came to the office and asked
for a College ‘Heat Complaint” book!

In the issue of “The College News” for
February 17th, I find, for the third time
since( mid-April, an announcement of the
award to me of a Fellowship. Now “The
News” never has been very strong on
grasping distinctions in academic honors;
for instance, Miss Greene, the present
fellow in Semitic languages, has recently
been heralded as holding a scholarship;
and among the items recorded in the ca-
reer of one of the British scholars, one
reads Mathematical TRIPES (sic!);
s0 what wonder that after three an-
nouncements “The News” has not yet
spoken exactly of this foreign Fellowship.
The announcements in question are as
follows:

April. 22, 1915 “a prize of $800
from the American School of Classical
Research”. (Note the magnificent if
meaningless title of the mythical institu-
tion!)

April 29, 1915 “the Research

Fellowship given by the American School |

of Archeology at Athens”.
February 17, 1916
ship in the American
Athens”.
Being a person averse to unnecessary |
attentions, I have never asked to have
any announcement made of this award,

“a Fellow-
Academy at

even though I am proud of being the first |
woman to hold the Fellowship. But since |

“The News” loves to dwell on the sub-
ject, I desire to prevent further garbling |

of the truth. Will you please state that

examination, awarded by the Archeolog-
ical Institute of America to be held in the
American School of Classical Studies in
Athens.

In conclusion, may I suggest that when
“The News” desires to report academic
honors it make some effort to learn from
authoritative sources just what may be
the nature of such honors.

Individual Liberty and College Principle
Ty the Editor of ‘The College Néws’’:

One of the principles of the authorities
of the College which seems to be little re-
garded by the students now-a-days is that
Sunday be kept as a day of rest. No as-
sociation meetings, nor academic appoint-
ments are allowed (not even ice cream
may be delivered at the College). No
regular exercise can be taken on Sunday,
the tennis courts, athletic fields, and
swimming pool may not be used. The
Christian Association has always stood
for the observance of Sunday, but feels
there is need of reminding its members
of its position. The Christian Associa-
tion Board therefore takes this means of
stating its firm conviction on the subject.
The board recognizes the right of the in-
dividual to liberty in her views and ac-
tion. Committee meetings, board meet-
ings, try-outs, and rehearsals for plays,
however, place an obligation on some who
might not otherwise work on Sunday.
Even if none of the members of a com-
mittee disapprove of such a meeting, the
committee should think of the precedent
they are establishing and the principle of
the College they are disregarding. Sun-
day is becoming more and more a day for
doing odd jobs instead of a day for rest
and worship. We should like to urge as
a board that the members of the Chris-
tian Association realize that Sunday is
one of their greatest opportunities “to
strengthen their religious life”.

To the Editor of “The College News”:

In answer to the letter which asks,
Where is our promised good skating?” all
we can say is that we have done the best
we could to have skating. According to
the agreement with the College, the re-
taining wall for the lower field was not
to be built until the summer of 1916, so
we hoped that the plan of sprinkling
would be successful for this year. Real-
izing that the skating on the old lower
field was never satisfactory, we have
‘tried experiments and made plans for a
skating pond in a better situation, so
that if everything goes as it should, there
will undoubtedly be good skating next
winter.

Pem. West Objects to Notoriety

Ty the Editor of ‘The College News’’:

self-government meeting and fire’ drill.
But I should like to ask in what way the
inner workings of Pembroke West are of

MAHLER’S SYMPHONY PLAYED
IN AMERICA FOR FIRST TIME



To Repeat Special Performance in April



On April 5th will be given a special per-
formance of Gustav Mahler’s Eighth
Symphony because of the success of the
two performances at the Academy of
Music last week. Because of the exces-
sive difficulty of the score and the large
number of voices required, the symphony
has been performed only twice before,
once in Munich and once in Berlin. Last
Friday it was performed for the first time
in America.

The Philadelphia Orchestra, enlarged
to 110 members, and the chorus of 958
voices, were conducted by Mr. Leopold
Stokowski. Since 1914, when he first
saw that it would be possible to produce
the symphony here, Mr. Stokowski has
been working steadily on its production.
The chorus, which includes 150 children,
has been training since last spring.

The symphony was written a little over
six years ago. It is based on an old Latin
hymn, “Veni Creator Spiritus”, and the
second part of Goethe’s “Faust”, includ-
ing all the characters and practically all
the dialogues. Gustav Mahler is a Bo-
hemian by birth. He was for a time at
the head of the Court Opera in Vienna.
In 1907 he came to America and was at
the head of the New York Philharmonic
Society until his death.

Are we in College observing the neu-
trality of the United States? This may
seem a foolish question—what can we
do?—but Saturday’s bleak headlines,
“Wilson Orders Villa Caught, Dead or
Alive”, have brought home, even here,
where the topic is little discussed, the
question of our relations with other
countries. We cannot help wondering
whether in a few months we may not be
at war with one country or another.
It is a state of affairs so much to be
dreaded that it is with something like
fear that we see how many people are
wearing around the campus the little
badges of the Allies colors. They cost a
quarter, we aretold. “The money goes to
the Relief Fund. as an act of charity.
One’s sympathies are pro-Ally’”. So far,
so good. It is most commendable to give
to charity, but for an American to flaunt
her unneutrality even in the seclusion of
Bryn Mawr is questionable. It is just this
“little drops of water, little grains of
sand”, sort of thing which is creating
among foreigners the conviction that the
United States as a whole is eager for a
chance to join the Allies, and which is
causing bad feeling in this supposedly
neutral country.

or all relief funds, but if our sympathies
are other than neutral let us keep them
shut up in our desk-drawers with our
badges.

OUTWARDLY LIFE UNCHANGED BY
WAR



Former Graduate Writes From Germany



Miss Marina Ewald, a German grad-
uate student at Bryn Mawr in 1912-13,
who is now teaching in a girls’ school in
Berlin writes of the feeling in Germany
as the war continues. She says “Out-
wardly our life goes on as it always did,
only that we all expect that after the
war taxation will be so heavy all over
Europe that it will make a very marked
and material difference in the comfort
we have hitherto been accustomed to.
So far one feels very little, if any, eco-
nomical depression or shortage of ma-
terial. The two vegetarian days that
shall be kept every week at first greatly
excited our housewives, but they soon
took to it as to any other regular habit.
“All in all it seems to me that people
are getting blunter towards everything,
as if one were only capable of a certain
amount of emotion and, that being spent,
one adapts one’s self to any kind of con-
dition without much resentment or men-
tal effort. So there was really hardly

vance of our troops in Servia, and so one
begins to pass the crippled, who aroused
so much feeling in the first year, more or
less untouched. I wonder whether the
time will ever come when I can feel the
world standing open to me, or whether
America will remain to me nothing but
a memory of that almost fabulous time,
‘before the war’.”’

RABBI WISE PLEADS FOR :
INTEGRITY OF INDIVIDUAL

te



“We ignore too often the significance of
personality”, said Rabbi Stephen Wise,
speaking Sunday night in the Chapel. “I
am pleading with you to-night that you
reverence your own souls. I am pleading
with you for the integrity of the indi-
vidual”.

Rabbi Wise spoke of what he called
the “tyranny of the many”, the thing
which is oppressing the individual. “We
believe too much in the power of num-
bers”, he said. “I can never help regret-
ting that in every tongue with which we
are acquainted there is some maxim such
as this: ‘The voice of the multitude is the
voice of God’”’.

Tyrannies of the Many

There are, Rabbi Wise pointed out, sev-
eral kinds of tyrannies, chief among
which are the tyranny of daily use and
habit, and the tyranny of the dead, “sub-
tle and insidious and almost irresistible
because there is a reverence for those
that were and are not in our presence”.
These tyrannies must be resisted, he said.
“If you yield to the world, if you accept
the commands of the world, if you bend
the knee to the many, what becomes of
your self-revering individual soul?

tain of your own soul. The world cannot

imprison it. I am pleading that your soul
shall be free and unfettered”.

There are many statesmen who regret
the fact that national spirit exists, yet
none would neglect the divisions among
men. In the same way many of us lament
class spirit, feeling that it works against
the best interests of the College; never-
theless, we accept it, and those who wish
to encourage enthusiasm in athletics or
to raise large sums of money find it a
convenient tool for their purposes.

The Christian Association has for sev-

of recognizing class spirit to attain effi-
ciency. Two years ago it was felt that
adequate class representation on the
Board was essential for proper interest
in the Association, and a Freshman was
put on the Board and the number of
Sophomores increased. Last year the
Board was chosen from candidates nomi-
nated by the classes. The reorganization
along class lines which took place on
Monday evening is the logical outcome of
these measures.

Undoubtedly the Association has chosen
the best way to get wider support, but it
incurs one great risk. We'do not want
four class Christian Associations. We
want four executive units, but one enthu-
siasm.

G. K. Chesterton’s haunting little lyric,
entitled “The Shakespeare Memorial’, is
particularly fitting at this time of
Shakespeare’ tercentennials. For the
benefit of our less well-read readers, we
reprint the first exquisite lines:

“Lord Lilac thought it rather rotten

That Shakespeare should be quite for-
gotten,

And therefore got on a Committee

With several chaps out of the city.

And while the vain world careless sped—

Unheeding the heroic name—

The souls most fed with Shakespeare’s
flame

Still sat unconquered in a ring,

Remembering him like anything”.

It is to be regretted that Bryn Mawr
has wandered so far from the Chesterto-
' Mian ideal. “Remembering him like any-
thing”! How little of that reminiscent
mood will be felt in three hundred years
toward the old constitution of the Chris-
tian Association, for instance, or towards
the‘once famous Trophy Club.

BASKET-BALL AND TRACK
SEASON OPENS



Outdoor athletics, track and basket-
ball, have begun this week. The lower
hockey fleld has been laid out into four
basket-ball fields and all the necessary
track paraphernalia has been arranged.
The track house has been moved from the
far side of the field to the terrace at the
end of the path coming down from the
campus. The new field will not be used
at all as it is to be seeded so that it will
be good for hockey in the fall.

has been given her for that purpose.

“I am going to understate rather than
overstate some things, for I do not
wish to seem to draw a bit on my
imagination. One hospital which I visited
has no water except in the garden, and
the infirmieres must carry up every drop
even to the third story. Even the mede-
cin-Chef said that the beds were impos-
sible for wounded, the mattresses being
something thin and lumpy in a ticking
hardly two inches thick. They had no
pillows also, and begged for them for the
gravely wounded. Here, too, they asked
for beef-juice or some similar dainty and
fortifying fare, for, as the infirmiere re-
marked, ‘Boiled meat and potatoes da
not tempt those who are enfeebled from
long. suffering, and we find it nearly im-
possible to get anything else’.

“Clothing is needed too, especially
socks and woollen things, pillows, gauze,
and cotton—but above all else surgical
appliances large and small. If people ask
what they can knit, say socks. Every-
where we are asked for them, large size,
because they shrink. No one asks for
scarfs or slings any more”.

Money for the Emergency Fund should
be given to me or sent to The French
Wounded Emergency Fund, 34 Lowndes
Square, London. In either case those who
give any sum_of money to the French
will receive a letter telling how it has
been spent.

FOR THE POLISH BABIES!



Alumna to Speak on Preparedness
for Women



The Honorable Mrs. Bertrand Russell,
who will speak Saturday afternoon in the
chapel on “Preparedness of Women for
Peace or War”, is a Bryn Mawr graduate
of the Class of 1890. Mrs. Russell has al-
ways been interested in social questions,
especially in their bearing upon children.
She is Chairman of the St. Pancreas
School for Poor Mothers, President of the
Abingdon British Women’s Temperance
Association, and a member of the com-
mittee of the National Women’s Suffrage
Societies of England.

Mrs. Russell’s talk on preparedness, il-
lustrated from the experience of women
in the present war, is for the benefit of
the babies of Polish refugees in Petro-
grad. Admission for members of the col-
lege is twenty-five cents, for outsiders
fifty cents. Contributions and pledges
may be given to the ushers at the door.
This lecture is to be given under the aus-
pices of the Bible and Mission Study Class
of the C. A., and also of the Red Cross
Committee.

SANDBY SOLOIST AT CONCERT



Herman Sandby, first violincellist of
the Philadelphia Orchestra, will be the
soloist at the concert Saturday evening
in the Gymnasium. Tickets for members
of the College are fifty cents, for out-
siders one dollar. Reserved seats may
be obtained at the office.

The program is:

I should like to explain a little more
fully the new plan for College admission
mentioned in last week’s “News” under
the heading, ‘Other Women’s Colleges
Adopt Entrance Examinations’. This
new plan, which will be put into effect.in
1919 in Mt. Holyoke, Smith, Vassar and
Wellesley Colleges, differs greatly from
the system of entrance examinations of
Radcliffe and Bryn Mawr Colleges:

Students must present, as heretofore,
fifteen points. They will be required to
take four. general examinations—one in
English or History, one in Mathematics,
Chemistry or Physics, one in any foreign
language, and the fourth from any of the
fifteen points which remain. Two of
these examinations must cover three-
point subjects. They will not be judged
alone for the amount of facts given, but
quite as much for the neatness, arrange-
ment and general ability and grasp of the
subject which the student displays; that
is, one page well written will be worth
more than two pages not well written,
even though they contain more facts than
the former.

Bach student must present, further, a
record of her college preparatory work
(covering in general four years, but not
limited to that time), and a statement
from her principal or principals of their
opinion of her ability. The record, the
opinion of the principal and the examina-
tions will all be considered in determin-
ing whether or not the student shall be
admitted. ;

CITIZENS MEET TO PLAN
COMMUNITY CENTER



A meeting of the citizens of Bryn Mawr
is to be held this week on Lancaster Pike
to discuss plans for a community center.
It is hoped that a place of general meet-
ing may be established, which can be
used by many organizations, such as the
Boy Scouts, Suffrage Clubs, Lectures,

Church Clubs and Exhibits. A need is

felt for a place for athletics, dancing,
swimming and games. Dr. Edwin Nes-
bit, the Inspector of Schools, is chairman
of the temporary committee to consider
the matter. Dr. Kingsbury, Miss Apple-
bee, and E. Dulles, College Settlement
Elector, have been asked to be on the
committee.

a Library Don'ts

At the beginning of the College year I
wish to bring to the attention of the new

students (and some of the old students |

need to read this too) a few of the rules
of the library buildings:

Don't laugh or talk loudly in the halls.

-Poh’t take out-door garments, coats,
sWeataie, etc., into the reading room.
Put tnent’s in the cloak room.

Don’t: bring food into the building.

Don’t touch the lights and fires in the]

reading room. The. janitor is here for
such duties.

Don’t carry inkwells around the build-
ing.

Don’t stay in the building after the 10
o’clock bell rings.

To the Class of 1920:

The Christian Association understands
that without the immediate co-operation
of your class its work will be much
weakened. For this reason we are tak-
ing advantage of the “News” to welcome
you warmly and to ask you to come to
the Wednesday Evening Meeting which
will be held to-night at 9.30 in the C. A.
Library. This meeting is your first op-
portunity in College to learn of the Asso-
ciation, and the leader, M. Bacon '18, will
talk on the work and plans for the year,
putting special emphasis on the help the

Association can give you and the help]:

you can give it. When the Christian Asso-
ciation was reorganized last year the aim
was to make it vital to every student in
College, but this aim cannot be accom-
plished unless the Class of 1920 shares it.

I have often read in your columns ex-
hortations from interested members of
the Christian Association on the subject
of attendance at. Sunday evening service
and weekday Chapel. If the energies of
these members were directed towards
providing prayer books and hymn books
so that we can all join in the service,
many of us might be inspired to attend
regularly. To try to share a book with
four other girls, or to attend a service in
which only the front rows of the Chapel
can join is not conducive to personal wor-
ship. As Freshmen have to sit at the
back of the room it is not to be wondered
at that they quickly lose their interest in
College services. Some day, when the
minister announces with innocent sar-
casm, ‘Let us read responsively’’, or “Let
us all join in singing”, I hope they will,
as is their habit in lectures, all wave their
hands in the air and draw attention to
their needs.

Chantecler.

Although a large number of Bryn
Mawr alumnae have spent some or all
of their time in social work after college,
not all have taken advantage of their
opportunities as undergraduates to dis-
cuss social problems and learn methods
of social work. There are many people
in college who have had some experience,
some who have had much experience,
and everyone represents a slightly differ-
ent point of view as to social and civic
needs, and how to meet them. The es-
sential thing is to bring the people to-
gether now for their mutual benefit and
to start an association which will help
them in their work after college.

The College Settlement chapter is for
this purpose. It is being reorganized
now. It is in a plastic state and you can
make it what you want. It will be a
stimulus to your real interests in social
work if you will tell us what they are,
The College Settlement Association
needs your support in its work and
offers you opportunities for training now
and even more especially after college.

To the Editor of the “College News”:

In reply to the letter by “Chantecler”
in your last issue, might I ask if he has
attended Chapel this year? Many of the
old hymn books that could not be used
have been rebound and there are now, I
think, almost a sufficient number to pro-
vide one book for every two persons.
Only the very back rows which I have
never seen occupied except upon such
state occasions as May .Day and the
Christmas service, are now left destitute.
As for the serious lack of books at morn-
ing Chapel the blame may be laid to the
door of Nelson, who has neglected to put
them round, he has been spoken to and
the defect will doubtless be remedied.
Furthermore I hope that a new supply of
books will soon be added to those we
already have so that there will be no
shortage whatsoever. In the meantime
will “Chantecler” play the part of a
Christian, however foreign it may be to
his nature, and bear with us a little.

POEM BY DR. CARPENTER



“Who Knows Not Circe’? a poem by
Rhys Carpenter, Ph.D., Associate Pro-
fessor of Classical Archeology at Bryn
Mawr, is published in the “Literary Di-
gest” for October 28, 1916. The magazine
may be found in the Magazine Room of
the Library, south wing.

The “Digest”, after some preliminary
remarks concerning the great American
poets, notably Lowell, who were in the
habit of reading their poems at meetings
of Phi Beta Kappa, refers directly to Dr.
Carpenter's poem. “Perhaps’’, writes the
reviewer, “a return to the days when the
name of this society of scholars was asso-

cated by the fact that a poem of distinc-

of the New York Delta of Phi Beta Kappa
last June’. The poem is quoted from the
September issue of the Columbia Univer-

LETTER FROM MME. CONS
TELLS OF POILU “FILLEULS”



Mme. Cons, before the war a member of
the Bryn Mawr faculty, writes her thanks
for money sent to her for the destitute
French soldiers to whom we were last
year requested to act as “marraines”.

She tells of Maurice Trioux,—‘‘a-most
forlorn man, and a most worthy one. Un-
til last month he had never had a letter
or a package from any one. He writes
often and begins every letter, ‘Oh, Mad-
ame Cons, que je suis heureux de pouvoir
vous faire une petite lettre, il me semble
que je suis rentré dans ma famille’. He
asked if he might call me ‘ma chere mar-
raine, car si je peux vous donner ce doux
nom je serai le poilu le plus heureux du
front’. Poor man—he nearly lost his life
the other day, the explosion of an obus
buried him alive under a pile of earth and
débris, but his comrades dug him out in
time.”

Money Needed More Than Anything

Money is especially needed. The small-
est amounts, pledged monthly, will be
acknowledged by Mme. Cons, or the poilu
who receives it. Contributions should be
sent to Miss Elizabeth White, The Marl-
borough-Blenheim, Atlantic City, N. J.
Mme. Cons writes, “I can use any amount
of money to good advantage. I am plan-
ning to use up my surplus every month
(i. e., all the money not needed for the
packages of my 130 or 140 men) in send-
ing packages to the men who have never
had any. I can get scores of such names
from men already on my list, and- shall
be so glad to help them through the win-
ter. Then too I will send socks, or shirts
or tobacco from time to time for distribu-
tion to a whole squad. It is not hard to
find ways of spending the money.

“Another thing that I should like is
gifts of socks, or wool for socks. I can
now afford to pay duty, and so will ask
to have any such gifts sent by foreign

other college the alumnz and undergrad- |

HOW TO LOCATE A CAREER



The Efficient Appointment Bureau



Scientific management is being applied
to the Appointment Bureau. In addition
to the series of vocational conferences
which has been started, the Bureau has
instituted the direct coéperation of vari-
ous Intercollegiate Bureaus of Occupation
for Trained Women and the listing of in-
formation as to definite posts open to
women in China for the next two years.

Connections with Intercollegiate Bu-
reaus in Boston, Baltimore, and Philadel-
phia have already been made and the
Bureau is working to establish the same
sort of connection with Bureaus in Chi-
cago and New York. The agreement is,
that whenever one of these bureaus can-
not fill a position for which it thinks Bryn
Mawr might have a candidate, it informs
the Bryn Mawr Appointment Bureau.
Whenever the Appointment Bureau has a
good candidate for any given locality, it
informs the corresponding bureau and the
candidate’s name is entered on its list of
applicants.

The Appointment Bureau is also send-
ing out letters to alumne asking them ‘to
register what their positions are and
whether they are willing to change them
for better ones. “We hope”, said Dean
Schenck, the Head of the Appointment
Bureau, “that alumnze who would consider
changing: their positions will keep their
registration with the Bureau up to date
in order that the Bureau may have a group
of experienced people to recommend for
the positions requiring experience that
are constantly being offered”. Letters ex-
plaining the work of the Bureau are being
prepared to send to principals of schools.
The list of schools includes a number

Serious: Discussion of Senate’s New
¥ By-law



Aiming to discuss matters interesting
to both the undergraduates and the alum-
ne, the Conference Committee of the
Alumne Association, consisting of L. Cad-
bury ’14, chairman, Marion Park ’98, Anna
Scattergood Hoag ’96 and K. McCollin '15,
met on Monday afternoon in Pembroke
East with-D. Shipley, President of the
Undergraduate Association; C. Hall, Pres-
ident of the Senior Class; K. Holliday,
Temporary President of 1918; M. Ewen,
Vice-President of 1919; M. Hutchins,
‘President of 1920, and Miss Jones, of the
Graduate Club.

Spy System Foreshadowed

The new by-law of the Senate, which
permits the Undergraduate Association to
recommend any student to the faculty for
misdemeanor, was felt to be a problem
worthy of serious consideration. Some
felt that the “may recommend” might be-
come “must recommend” and thus a spy
system be established.

Personal Behavior Criticised

Loud talking on trains, monopolizing
sidewalks and petty gossiping about Col-
lege affairs instead of clean criticism
were spoken of by the committee, which
felt that alumne visiting at College were
not to be excepted from blame, and that
although these were isolated cases they
reflected on the College as a whole.

The undergraduates explained that Self-
Government has no jurisdiction over
alymne visiting in the halls as some have
thought, but that the rules governing
them are identical with Self-Government
rules.

‘ach Association was discussed in turn.
The alumne felt that Self-Government
was especially strong this year, and Miss
Cadbury spoke of the alumne’s enjoy-
ment of their game with Varsity, which
“treated them like human beings”. The
plan of the Music Committee’s acting as
advisors to the Endowment Fund in rais-
ing money was viewed with approval.

E. King, ex-'14 Sent by Scolety of Friends

Estelle King; ex-’14, who has been work-
ing in Belgium refugee camps in Holland,
talked informally to the students Thurs-
day evening, in Merion Sitting Room.
‘Miss King, who was sent by the English
Society of Friends, spent eight months in
Ede and other refugee colonies in Hol-
land directing work rooms and classes.

“Though most of the richer Belgians
have managed to support themselves or
have gone to England or America”, Miss
King said, “the Dutch have cared for
thousands in these camps and have solved
fairly adequately the difficult problem of
looking out for a large population sud-
denly thrust upon them”, Each one is
given a straw mattress, knife, fork, spoon
and clothes and each family is allotted
a room about twenty feet square, all pro-
vided by the Dutch government. The
refugees are, however, expected to help
in their support by making hats, brushes
and toys for sale,

All the children under sixteen have to
go to school. The Society of Friends has
organized a division of Boy Scouts and
gymnastics are taught.

There are three large camps like the
one at Ede, one of them a prison camp,
where spies and criminals are kept. All
the camps are watched and surrounded
by walls so the authorities can keep the
people out of trouble.

Opportunities which government agen-

courts offer for the improvement of rural
communities were outlined in part by
Jane Smith, ""10 at a meeting of the Col-
lege Settlement Chapter on Thursday
night.

In the line of education, an interesting
endeavor is being made, she said, in Mis-
souri and some other States, to consoli-
date the small schools of country districts
in one large school building. The chil-
dren from an area of about eighty square
miles are taken to a central school build-
ing in which all the grades through the
High School are taught.

Recreation is made easier according to
Miss Smith by the phonograph and the
automobile. These are considered almost
necessities now, she added, so much so
that one family, possessing no lamps,
spent the evenings outdoors in front of
their shack reading the newspaper by the

lights of three automobiles and a motor
cycle.

Now that water-polo has begun and we
are entering upon the usual season of
colds due to coming home across the
campus on cold nights, overheated and
with wet hair floating in the breeze, I
wish to fly in the face of tradition and
demand that it be abolished. Why tolerate
a sport, which, on account of its strenu-
ousness, is dangerous to the health and
anything but amusing? Water-polo was
introduced at Bryn Mawr by Miss Thomas
at a time when there were few other
sports. Then, perhaps, it filled a need.
Now it has outlived its usefulness. We
have tennis, hockey, basket-ball, track,
and in the winter season, gymnasium
drill, sports to which we enjoy devoting
our energies. Why struggle to keep alive
enthusiasm for a game that only a be-
nighted sense of “duty to the class” or
“It’s awfully mean to leave the captain in
the lurch” induces us to play.

“| eitgaate teen Prekeunk ‘Thomas’ Address
Before the Graduate Association, No-
vember 24, 1916, on “The Relation of
Professional Men and Women College
Graduates to Public Affairs”.

There is no trouble whatever in defin-
ing the .duty towards public affairs of
women college graduates who are not at
work at any special job of their own. It
is clear that the occupation—or at least
the avocation—that such college women
will have, is public affairs. At the recent
Pennsylvania State Woman Suffrage Con-
vention on the roll of the 161 women
there, all of whom were active suffrage



‘workers, there was hardly a spinster. The

married women and other women classi-
fied in the census as “without occupa-
tion”, were using their greater freedom
to work for suffrage. All agree that
women without absorbing occupation
ought at the present time to make them-
selves useful and work for the public
good, and the best way for them to begin
to be useful is by informing themselves
of social and civic conditions.

Professional women divide themselves
into two classes, those teaching or in-
tending to teach in schools or colleges
and those who are practicing or studying
law and medicine. First of all, there is
that small and wonderful subdivision of
teachers and students made up of those
women who have a gift for research and
independent scholarly work. These be-
long in a class by themselves. They are
specialized by their wonderful power like
poets, prose writers, musicians, artists,
dancers, or anyone else with unusual and
splendid talent. They ought not to con-
cern themselves with public affairs. It is
their supreme duty to devote themselves
to research and investigation. Every one
of us must feel that there should be many
more geniuses than there are among
women. AS a sex we squander genius. I
have known women endowed with this
marvelous power of research get their
own breakfast in the morning. Think of
a Newton or an Edison taking time to
cook his own breakfast.

But what is the duty toward public af-
fairs of teachers who are not geniuses?
Of course every teacher is a much better

teacher if she is familiar with outside),

affairs and can bring them into relation
with her teaching. She is enormously
helped by keeping in touch with the world
of men and women and bringing to her
pupils a wider vision and a broader out-
look on life. She must read and must
inform herself of the great social and
economic changes and the great reform
movements that we are living through.
Only so will her teaching live. But active
reform work is difficult for teachers for
two reasons. First, a teacher’s task is
such that she is exhausted after the four
or four and a half hours of daily teaching"

Probably the College is aware of some
of the recent escapades of a group of the
Class of 1920, and also of the fact that
the Class of 1919 officially voted the Class
of 1920 as “fresh”, I should like to say
that the letter written by 1919 to 1920, in-
forming them of our action, was sent in
an entirely friendly spirit, and I would
especially like to acknowledge the ex-
ceedingly sportsmanlike and _straight-
forward reply received from 1920. I sin-
cerely hope this incident has left no hard
feeling and has been to the good of all
concerned.

To the Editor of the “College News”:
Maybe there are some people who enjoy

spending their five periods of exercise
swinging Indian clubs, dancing, or mak-
ing a stab at fencing in the gymnasium,
but, surprising as it may seem, there are
others among us who enjoy “taking a hot
bath with soap” and having real exercise
in the pool twice a week. May we sug-
gest that those weaklings who haven’t
sense enough to dry their hair by the ex-
cellent hairdryer, cover their heads before
leaving the gym and .avoid traditional
colds.

SLANG INGENIOUSLY EXPRESSIVE



Enlivening as Poetry

Even “for those who are too refined to
think, it must be evident that the tech-
nique of vividness in slang is the same
as that in poetry”, according to an article
in the New Republic last week. “Of
course, like all poetry that becomes es-
tablished, it loses its original vigor and
comes to be used automatically and with
stale perception. ‘Muff’ and ‘Hunch’ are
as ingeniously fitted into the mechanics
of social life as any words. ‘Bluff’ and
‘Crib’ and ‘Flunk’ are entirely practical’.

Much of slang is as vivid as Shake-
speare, the article asserts, and reminds
one of Falstaff. Professors should warn
their pupils, not against slang, but against
the deadness of habitually using expres-
sions without discriminating as to their

'
| A NEW OUTLET FOR DISCUSSION |

Problems outside of College are to be |

held every Friday night after dinner in
56 Rockefeller. The informal discussion |
| will not be limited to set topics.

This new movement is not under any
Association and is not to be definitely or-
ganized. The plans for such a meeting
were formulated after a long and inter-
ested discussion with the College Settle
ment secretary, Miss Baldwin. Although
the C. S. A. has fostered such clubs in |
other colleges, it has only been a stimulus
in this case and is not responsible for the |

“S Headed by'a committee called the Cen-



tral Organization Committee of the Rose-

mary Purchase Fund, former Rosemary | —

pupils are campaigning to raise a fund
for the purchase of the School and to
change it, under the Connecticut law,
from a private corporation to a semi-pub-
lic educational institution. The commit-
tee has secured an option to purchase the
School, officially appraised at $247,198,
for $150,000. $3,000 has already been col-
lected.

Rosemary Hall, a well known boarding
school for girls in Greenwich, Connecticut,
is at present a private corporation with
capital stock owned by the headmis-
tresses, Miss Ruutz-Rees and Miss Lown-
des. Under their control it pays no divi-
dends and turns its profits back into the
improvement of the plant. It is to make
permanent this type of administration,
which future headmistresses might not
wish to continue, that the Rosemary Pur-
chase Fund was organized. If the change
is made, the School will probably be con-
trolled by a Board of Trustees chosen
from its former pupils.

In explaining the plan to Rosemarians
the pamphlet which has been sent them
says: “This is by no means a new idea
in the educational world, but if the plan
succeeds, Rosemary will stand among the
pioneers in this form of government for
girls’ boarding-schools in the United
States. It is obvious that a school of the
proposed type, so organized that it can
bring financial profit to no one, inspires
a measure of confidence and secures a
permanence impossible under private
ownership. In the case of Rosemary, the
former pupils are convinced also— that,
under this form of control, they can best
perpueuate the ideals in pursuit of which
the School has been developed, namely:
Standardized college preparatory work,
interscholastic athletics, and student self-
government”,

The only regret of the two hundred and
twenty-five persons who heard Herman
Sangby play last Friday for the benefit of
the Endowment Fund was, I feel sure,

that there were not more people to hear |

him. The concert, given under the aus-
pices of the Senior Class, was the first of
several planned by the separate class
endowment committees to take the place
of the former Music Committee concerts.
As a result of the small attendance on
Friday we lost $25. When. the present
plan of giving concerts accepted in an
undergraduate meeting, an attempt was
made to impress upon the members of
the association their individual responsi-
bility to support any entertainments for
the Endowment Fund, as far as possible.

To complete the sum of $10,000 which
we have pledged for June, 1917, we have
still $5100 to raise. The total due for

ithe year 1915-16 amounted to $4500. Ap- |

proximately $350 has been reported for
this year. Of this $225 comes from the}
Senior Class, $95 from 1918, and $30 from |
1919. At the beginning of the year it was
decided that each class should raise $1000
and that $1000 should be raised by some
big entertainment. Since the 1915-16 re-
port was short $500, that too must be

The personal charges made by the
“Tipyn o’ Bob” of January 10th against
the conservatism of the Executive Board
of Self-Government and its “too retiring
intelligence” have been answered, in the

| first, as appeared in last week’s “News”,
| that early in November the Board began
/on its own initiative an Investigation of
ithe rules of the Association, an act un-
backed by anything so conservative as a
precedent; second, that the Board in pro-
posing its revisions to the Association
last Wednesday made no attempt in the
case of the most important change to “put
over” the.decision it favored on the As-
sociation.

The real point at stake in the “Tipyn
o’ Bob” editorial, however, is the ques-
tion of democracy. Whether one agrees
or does not agree that executive boards
are a stupid set will not matter in the
long run. What does matter is the state
of mind, by no means peculiar to the
writer in the “Tipyn o' Bob”, which re-
nounces democracy and declares self-gov-
ernment impossible merely because exec-
utives are at fault. It is the same old cry

“the country is going to the dogs”
with the same old helpless attitude be-
hind it.

HEAD OF. EMPLOYMENT BUREAU
SCORES COLLEGE JOB SEEKERS



“People Want to Get Paid for Nothing” ’
Says Miss Malone, in Personal
_ Interview



“People want to get paid for nothing.
The kind of jobs they want are the kind

‘17 in telling a member of the “News”
staff her experiences as head of the Col-
lege Employment Bureau.

As an example of this easy sort of job
Miss Malone mentioned the agency for
malted milk, which consists of delivering
samples all around the College and then
pocketing ten dollars. Of course, she con-
tinued, agencies are impossible this year
because no one will buy anything unless it
is for the Endowment Fund, but next year
there will be a certain number available.
Besides the desire for easy jobs, Miss Ma-
lone commented on the low standard of
work done by applicants to the Employ-
ment Bureau.

“The standard of work’, she _ said,
“should be as high in College as outside
College. Persons should feel as respon-
sible to the Employment Bureau as they
would to a regular employer. Instead,
they require constant supervision and it
never occurs to them that the people that
are paying for them want the best pos-
sible work and are entitled to get it.
On the other hand, those who want work
done usually come at the last minute and
then we can’t give them the best service”.
But, she concluded, that will never be
rectified.

Loan Committee Planned

About plans for new kinds of work,
Miss Malone was more optimistic. The

who no longer have any use for them and
sell or rent them to incoming students.
Such a committee would probably con-
sist of one or two students who would
finance and organize the undertaking
themselves and keep all the profits. Such
a committee would benefit both the stu-
dents who ran ‘it and the students who
want second-hand things. Miss Malone
thought students would be willing to co-
operate in giving their old books to sucha
committee when they consider how little
they make by selling them as individuals
and how much it could make for one or
two persons who need the money.

of the Bryn Mawr Presbyterian Church,
will be held in Room F, Taylor, Wednes-

best known to the Presbyterians in Col-

when he preached in Chapel: last— year,
that he was secured for this series of
classes. He has been instrumental in
establishing the Community Center in

“Why not do, without the scourge of

“Nations under the pressure of war
have become temperate in a day, have
given up luxury and done away with
waste, have learned generosity”, he went
on to say. “All the giving through offi-
cial channels to victims of the war has
come from 50,000 people, that leaves
over 99,000,000 people yet to give. If we
think we have been generous we should
consider that we have only given eleven
cents per capita for the Belgians, while
New Zealand in its poverty has given a

FICTION LIB SCARCELY EXISTS

Has Outlived Its Usefulness, Says M.

O'Shea 3



NO SUPPORT AT PRESENT



According to M. B. O’Shea ’17, who is
on the Library Committee of the Under-
graduate Association, “half the people in
College don’t know the Denbigh Fiction
Library exists. The library has outlived
its usefulness. It has no spontaneous
support”. T. Howell ‘18, the librarian,
says that the library is used as much this
year as it was last year. ,

The money to buy books for the fiction
library is collected by the librarian. The
committee then meets to select books to
be bought. Last year about thirty were
put in the library,. but “the popular
opinion is that they ought to be best-
sellers”, said Miss O’Shea. “There were
protests against such books as George
Moore’s ‘Evelyn and Ness’ as being too
‘high-brow’ for the library. This”, she
said, “is a highly undignified attitude for
a college community”.

Transfer Good Books to Main Library

The solution of the difficulty, Miss
O’Shea thinks, would be to transfer the
good new books now in the fiction li-
brary to the main library, possibly to the
New Book Room. In this she is upheld
by Miss Reed. Miss Reed is willing “to
take over the books that would be of per-

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

(The editors do not hold themselves responsible
for opinions expressed in this column)

To the Editor of the College News:
In answer to an editorial in the College

News of last week I should like to state |

why it was that the question of having
professional auditors for the accounts of
the student organizations of the College
was not suggested at the undergraduate
meeting at which the motion to have
these accounts audited was passed. Half
of the aim of the motion was to teach
the members of the organization and as
many of the other members of the asso-
ciation as possible proper accounting, as
well as just to see that the money of the
associations was properly taken care of.
There is no better practice for this sort
of thing than auditing. Mr. Hurst, the
comptroller of the College, has most
kindly helped in showing the Auditing
Committee a simple system of accounts,

according to which all the student ac- |
counts of the College may be kept, and he |
strongly advised that the College be given |
the practice in auditing, thinking it quite |

possible for us to do it in the correct man-
ner. It was for this reason that it was
not thought necessary to bring up the
question of professional auditors.

Four boys about twelve years old held
}an extemporaneous debate at the Com-
‘munity Center Friday night on the rela-
‘tive value to the community of Movies
‘and the Community Center. There were
four boys to begin with, but when it came
time for the third debater he had stage
| fright and ran from the room. This was
| the first debate of the younger boys’ de-
| bating club.

| The affirmative side arguing for the
| Movies was reduced to one, who took up
all the different points and the rebuttal
with perfect assurance. One of the argu-
;}ments brought forward to uphold the
| Movies at the expense of the Community
Center was that “I was so enthusiastic
about the Community Center that I use’
ter stay all the evenin’ sometimes till ten
o'clock, which is too long”’.

The point most discussed was the edu-
| cational value. “You can see the growth
of mushroems or the development of fish
which takes a long time in twenty sec-
londs”. But, said the negative, “I can see
| those pictures for twenty seconds and
| afterwards I don't know no more than I
|did before. Teachers always use books
/and you can see the pictures in the books
/and study it out too”.

“What good is it to children who want
|} to see something interesting to go to the
movies and see love stories all the time”?
| continued the negative. ‘You may go to
the movies and pay your money and get
| fooled and see a rotten love story”.
| The affirmative brought out ingeni-
|}ously that having a good movie in town
|kept the people from going away, but the
‘negative won the debate because they
| showed that besides amusement and edu-
;cation the people made new acquaint-
‘ances at the Community Center and got
/most everything “cheap”.

Cannot something be done about the

by now we are all accustomed to the dis-

BRYN MAWR BEDS NOW
ENDOWED FOR NEUILLY



Constance Lewis Fund
Complete This Month



SURPLUS GOES TO HOSPITAL TOO



The fund that Constance Lewis ‘04
started before her death on November 5,
1916, to endow two beds for one year at
the American Ambulance Hospital at
Neuilly is now complete. The fund has
reached $1484.17, $1200 was .sent to
Neuilly ($600 for each bed), and $284.17,
the surplus collected, to the New York
office of the hospital to be used as nec-
essary.

A letter has already been received from
Maurice Burger, the present occupant of
one of the beds. It was addressed “Bryn
Mawr College’, and reads in _ part:
“Messieurs, c’est un petit blessé francais
qui a le bon chance d'occuper le ‘Bryn
Mavr lit’ dans la salle 67 de l’Ambulance

bien sincerement de votre offre genereuse
en vue de mon prompt establissement.
Je remerce beaucoup les docteurs
infermiers et infermiers de l’Ambulance
Américaine que me soignérent et qui
me soigne aussi actuellement”,.

In making her appeal for money, Miss
Lewis sent letters to over 2800 alumnze
and former students of Bryn Mawr. It
was her wish that the two beds should
bear the name-plate, “Bryn Mawr Col-
lege”, though the fund was started by
her. She also appealed to the Bryn Mawr
clubs in various cities, but only the Wash-
ington club responded. Miss Lewis her-
self paid all the expenses of the cam-
paign.

Fund Now Closed

A letter of February 12th received from
Miss Lewis’ father explains the closing
of the fund. “A total of $1484.17 was
obtained, the last subscription of $3 hav-

now are few, small and infrequent, it is

last Monday evening. This committee
will take charge of the support of a vil-
lage in Belgium to which the college as
a whole, under the auspices of the Chris-

M. M. Carey ’20. The committee must
report to the Association before taking
any definite action.

Because of the urgent need for haste,
Miss McFaden appealed for immediate
action. A second motion was passed to
protect the Christian Association from
future indebtedness by stipulating that
appropriations should not go on the bud-
jet but should remain a matter of indi-
vidual subscription.

I wish to draw the attention of the Col-

so prevalent on the campus last Sun-
day afternoon. Groups of students. gath-
ered in different places, under friends’
windows and in rooms with notably open
windows, and vented their extra spirits
in boisterous song, ranging from popular
songs to hymns. All this went on during
the hours from choir practise to vespers,
to the edification of the Sunday afternoon
visitors who were swarming the campus.
Sunday is the one day when we may ex-
pect many visitors and on that day may
we not demand some dignity of behavior
on the part of the students?

Cc. A. NUMBERS NEARLY THREE
HUNDRED STUDENT MEMBERS



Only One Faculty Is Full Member



The membership statistics of the Chris-
tian Association show that 298 students
are members of the Association. In ad-
dition there are twenty honorary mem-
bers from the faculty and staff. Miss Ap-
plebee is the only active member of the

Association from the staff. The repre-

The faculty members are, for the most
part, the result of a canvass in the fall
when 100 cards inviting membership were
sent out. That there were not more re-
sponses the committee believes due to the
small part honorary members have in the
life of the association. Though Bryn
Mawr will probably never approximate
the custom of the Vassar Christian As-
sociation of having a member of the fac-
ulty on each committee, the honorary
members may in the future be sent cards
to the C. A. reception, and shown in other
ways that their support is recognized.

“The great gift that College, and we
like to think that Bryn Mawr especially,
gives women, is the ability for clear
thinking”, was the statement of Mrs. Mar-

Vespers Sunday evening. What the stu-

ity to think and transform it into action
on behalf of some part of humanity.

At the conference this summer Mrs.

a consideration of the responsibility of
the American woman to-day in view of
the European situation.

In response to an urgent appeal to
Bryn Mawr for clothing of all kinds for
the people in Noyon and other French
towns recently evacuated by the Ger-

mans, the Junk Committee is organizing a

special “French Bundle Week” from May
10-17.

May we appeal through your columns
to every reader of the “News” to give
some old clothes. We need 2000 articles.
As this amount cannot be gathered by
the junk collectors alone we are asking
everyone to collect their own junk and
take it to the nearest receiving station.
The bundles will be taken every day to

the gymnasium and boxes packed as soon |

as possible.

ROMANCE OF THE: FUTURE
_ A CRYSTAL AGE”

| A Naw Book and an Old One in the New

Book Room

“It belongs to the rare type of fiction
which has given us Gulliver and Ere-
whon”, says the foreword to “A Crystal

ge”, by W. H. Hudson. Written thirty
years ago by an author only recently ap-
preciated, it now takes rank in the New
Book Room as a new book along side of
the freshly published “Renascence of
France”, by Charles Sarolea, which cele-
brates the'rebirth of the Gallic’ spirit to
meet the crisis of the Great War.

Galsworthy has said that “as a stylist
Iiudson has few if any living equals” and
“\ Crystal Age” in Mr. Hudson’s rhyth-
mic prose tells the story of a second Rip
Van Winkle who wakes to find himself in
a Utopian world where he is sadly out
of place.

The coming of France’s new life is
traced in Mr. Sarolea’s book through a
series of historical sketches of great
French men and women from Montaigne
and Madame de Maintenon to Bergson
and Poincaré. “The New France” is the
last chapter and the last words are “The
French Ideals are themselves universal
because they appeal to the whole of civ-
ilized humanity, because they partake of
he eternal verities”.

To the Bditor of the College News:

erevracey Commasiiigha @e iuxe -Cimnseaia
The Gorham Press has just published

Helen Williston Brown ’06, whose muse
_| attended her through Rosemary, Bryn
;|Mawr, and the medical school of Johns
Hopkins into a world of suffrage and
feminism. That is no doubt an unusual
career for a muse, and insures an inter-
est for the book. For one knows that in
the inevitable mirror of self-expression,
even where there is not art, there is hon-
esty. In Mrs. Brown’s verse one may
easily forgive a technique still undevel-
oped, and an art not over true, for the
sake of following an autobiography more
interesting and more informing than the
prose record of dates and events which
the usual chronicle-of-self supplies.

The best part of a book review comes
in quotation marks. Mrs. Brown ar-
ranges the collection under the headings,
“At Rosemary”, “At Bryn Mawr”, “At
Johns Hopkins Medical School”, and
“Post Hoc” (to which without unkindness
one may supply the “Ergo Propter Hoc”
of the schoolmen); but much of the
charm of the book lies in the superfluous
information. The reader of the College
News may test this for herself in the
following:

“The coloured lady with rheumatic pains
Of ten years’ standing and an endless row
Of ugly babies, patched with eczema.
Coffee and cabbage and a taste of beer,
As like as not will prove to be their fare.
The little boy with the infected knee,
How his face haunts you!

So it goes”.

or in this from the verses “To Dr.-Anna
Howard Shaw” :—

“Till that time shall come when man

May prove his chivalry, and give

The symbol of their freedom,

To the women who have hoped for it so
long”.

One may easily guess the scene for the
lines:

“

on the gray stone walls the
ivy buds
Shimmer and grow”,

and with more difficulty the setting for
the poem called “Hero-Worship”:—

I listened for his step upon the stairs,—

Then when at last he came,

And I could hear him in the dingy hall

With rattling keys unlock his office door,

The library wherein I toiled

O’er chemistry in German,

Suddenly appeared a more attractive spot.

And as I read I heard his footsteps

Come and go along the passage way,

Or in the laboratory, and I knew

From long and close attention,

Just what he was at,—

Combustions maybe or a melting point,—

And I was quite content in knowing he
was there”.

With the entrance of the United States
into the war the problem of food supply—
which, with the constant rise in prices
has for months been a matter of growing
‘anxiety to the individual consumer—has
assumed overwhelming proportions. Sud-
denly we have been brought face to face
with the problem of feeding nations. Ac-
cordingly when Mr. P. M. Sharpless of
West Chester offered Bryn Mawr College
the use of twenty acres of fertile land for
this summer, we saw before us not only
the opportunity of supplying our own in-
dividual need of vegetables for the com-
ing year, but also an opportunity for na-
tional service.

The primary purpose, then, of the Bryn
Mawr College Farm is increased produc-
tion. Secondarily, however, the farm is
to serve a number of other good causes.
Under the competent management and in-
struction of Mr. A. D. Cromwell, Profes-
sor of Agriculture in the West Chester
Normal School,- about eighty students
will acquire valuable experience in the
growing of vegetables and in their con-
servation by canning, drying, and storing,
in problems of transportation and selling
of vegetables. Further, the farm is to be
a piece of research work from which Mr.
Cromwell expects to draw useful conclu-
sions as to the comparative merits of
various vegetable crops as producing defi-
nite numbers of calories per unit of
ground per unit of work. This will be
done by having each individual cultivate
a cross section containing eight or ten
vegetables. The worker will keep an ac-

curate account of the number of hours
spent on each vegetable. The relation of
the food value of each particular crop to
the cost of production,—-seed, fertilizer,

siniat, dieses posadh Ween hecaieh « ve |'
and valuable economic contribution at

the present crisis. - Last of all we hope
| that’ the Bryn Mawr College Farm will|



successful conclusion a kind of produc-
tive work heretofore done only by men.
The land to be used is an outlying farm
of the Sharpless estate,—situated a quar-
ter of a mile from Fern Hill, two stations
this side of West Chester. Mr. Cromwell,
with a Government expert, has planned
the crops to be grown according to the
character and situation of the land as
follows: 5 acres of potatoes, 5 acres of
sweet corn, 10 acres of general garden
truck.

The vegetables grown will be disposed
of as follows: Root vegetables will be
kept in cold storage for the use of the col-
lege next winter. Everything suitable
will be canned or dried directly on the
farm. Perishable surplus will be sold for
immediate consumption. Week-end bas-
kets will be sent to families ordering
them.

Students doing the work on the farm
and in the canning houge wijl be paid at
the rate of twenty cents an hour. Ac-
curate time cards will be kept. Students
will be at the farm for periods varying
from two weeks to four months. It is be-
lieved that they will be able to work
seven or eight hours a day. Under these
conditions they will be able to meet their
living expenses.

A desirable house has been leased in
West Chester. This will accommodate 25
people, the number required throughout
the summer, and meals will be provided
at an adjourning boarding house. The
wardens, or other officials of the college
will act as chaperons.

Work on the farm was begun on May
12th, will be in full swing by the be-
ginning of June, and will continue till
October. During this period it is believed
that enough vegetables will be raised and
conserved to supply the college for the
year 1917-1918 and thus release for gen-
eral consumption what otherwise would
have been bought from public markets.

JUNK MAGAZINES IN WAR ZONE
360 for Torpedo Boat Destroyer

The torpedo boat destroyer “Jarvis”,
soon to be in service in the war-zone, has
received 360 magazines collected at col-
lege by E. Rondinella, chairman of the
library committee of Junk. Only the
men-o’-war are equipped with libraries by
the Government. The smaller craft are
being equipped with reading material by

things we ought to hear. A favorite was
“Patterns”, which appeared in the Atlan-
tic Monthly last summer and which, Miss
Lowell said, showed the enlargement pos-
sible in vers libre. Before giving “Dol-
phins in Blue Water’, a poem of two
movements, Miss Lowell explained some-
thing of the theory of cadence in lan-
guage, which corresponds to phrasing in
music. It is a matter of stress and force,
she said, which has nothing to do with
the length of the line. This has been sci-
entifically proved through certain phono-
graphic experiments made on Miss Low-
ell’s verse by Mr. Patterson of Columbia.
The curves can be felt most readily by
young people, particularly if they are
good dancers. Mr. Masefield’s rhythmic
sense is not his strong point, asserted
Miss Lowell, for he reads his poetry as
though it were prose.

Other poems read by Miss Lowell were
“Before an Altar’, “A Lady”, in which
the poet’s vigor is compared to a bright
new penny thrown down before her; “The
Letter”, and “The Hammers”, a narrative
poem taking, as Miss Lowell warned her
audience, a half-hour to read. “The Bom-
bardment”, describing the attack on
Lidge, was read at the request of Mile.

'rushlight’s melancholy—and _ well-con-|
| structed beam.
The College Inn, May 22, E. Hill.



vo ae Etc ane cies]

in this morning’s ~News’ invites a little
further comment on. the- seniors’ plays,
for the reason that those of your. —
who were so fortunate as. ‘to enjoy”
critique and so unfortunate as to niles
the acting, may wonder why some of us}
think these one-act plays worthy of per-
formance.

We must all agree with your critic
when he says that it takes a good deal
of imagination to mend gossamer, To
make the gossamer in the first place,
takes some imagination. But why on
ear.h should anybody except a Freud
lament that such dream stuff doesn’t
make him think? For my part, I was
quite content to dream; to watch the
shimmering humour of the delicate char-
acterization. Characterization, though it
hadn’t the sure touch of a minstrel show,
was, I think, the charm of the fantasy.
I liked to see how the author had com-
bined the typical and the individual, the
conventional and the unexpected, turning
her puppet-play into a (tiny comedy of
arts. I didn’t look for much action on a
mantelpiece, nor expect to find it on the
frail platform set up in a college quad-
rangle.

As to Miss O’Shea’s hands, no per-
fumer’s list, not even Flaubert’s, could
explain them. Might one proffer a
museum catalogue—since India and West
Philadelphia are so far away? Might
one hazard a guess that we, less robust
than they of Pater’s time, resist a pun
to fall before a metaphor? How else ex-
plain the sentence which ushers in that
dastardly attack on poetry at Bryn
Mawr. And as for the clock’s hands,—
hands seem to interest your reviewer—
they were almost--too well-behaved. Oh
happy critic, never to have seen the
hands of a clock go forward and then
backward, beset by weary glances! And
yet these details are far less important
than the idea of the poet, who tried to
stammer what nature told him, or of the
fragrance, that floated incense-like from
her jar to follow the teaching of the wise
old God,

Undoubtedly Miss O’Shea’'s theme is
to some extent disagreeable. Young
Irishmen in love—even Young Irishmen,
when they are so much in love that they
lose their sense of values—are likely to
be disagreeable. But in this case the
motive seems to turn not on the man’s
but on the woman’s attitude; and I feel
sure that Miss O’Shea did not traduce
Ireland when she sacrificed the man’s
ideal to the idealism of the woman.

For I, too, know what happened! They
are sad wags who dine in Théléme. One
ean’t expect them to leave a glorious
Rabelaisian mood at the edge of the
campus. Strayed from remoter revels,
a critic ought not to be asked to keep
his eye on the object. He _ probably
couldn't, just then. (Doesn't .this solu-
tion agree beautifully with the Shaun

i tata ewe |



celebration theory?) And moods are di-
verting; only, it isn’t a mirror or a
monocle—it’s an opera glass—that helps |
one to see a play.

And so I can still thank the seniors
for an agreeable evening; and can look |
forward to The Lantern with the greater.

Tenth Reunion Brings Greatest Number

(Continued from page 1.)

A picnic took the place of 1914’s supper
on Monday evening and about 40 came
back for it.

An ex-president of Self-Government, E.
B. Smith, was '15’s toastmistress at their
banquet in Merion Saturday. The speak-
ers were H. Bradford, Dean of Women
at Leland Stanford University; I. Foster,
founder of the College News; O. Erbsloh,
M. Jacobs, M. Keller Heyl, mother of the
class baby; A. Kenyon, an ex-president
of the Undergraduate Association; M. M.
Chamberlain Moore, K. Mc@ollin, and E.
Van Horn. The headquarters for 1915
have been in Rockefeller. They had no
costume this year.

An oyster shell on a light blue ribbon
composed 1916’s costume. 39 were pres-

in Rockefeller, where L. Klein was toast-
mistress. The speakers were A. Werner,
ex-president of the Undergraduate Asso-
ciation; D. Packard, M. Dodd Sangree,
M. Russell, ex-president of Self-Govern-
ment, and M. Branson, ex-president of the
Athletic Association. The class bulletins
recording the “past, present and future”
of 1916 were place cards. Their head-

I have been interested in the discus-
sion of the giving of May Day, and it has
brought to mind the early days of the
war in England, when the inelegant slo-
gan, “Business as usual’, expressed
much heroism above the realm of trade.
The way in which English men and
women carried on the difficult living of
usual days in unusual times, is the most
inspiring memory, brought home by one
American. In one household there, then,
and later, when one son was invalided,
one killed in France, and the third at
Gallipoli, the sparkling tea-tray is brought
in at five, the usual vacations are taken,
and in those familiar ways, there ap-
peared to be some steadying comfort.
Harry Lauder, not long after his son
had fallen, went back on to the stage, and
sang in his heartening rollicksome voice,
“The boys will come marching home”.
If some of the actresses at May Day
should have heavy hearts, they will not
be the first, who, in spite of them, have
danced and smiled.

May Day remains one of the most ex-
quisite memories of one’s college life.
It is more than an aggregation of cos-
tumes, arrangements, tickets’ and pro-
ceeds. It is of value, as anything beau-
tiful is. In this year of horrors, such
things should be guarded and given, with
spscial care, because men and women
and even children should be made to for-
get for a few hours the burden of the war,
and freshen their spirits with the sight
of a spring festival. If there was any-
thing’ really bacchanalian or unbridled
about it, I could see the inadvisability of
it for this year, but Bacchus himself, in
my time, acted with such artistic feeling
that those who should know found only
edification in his maudlin revel (he was
president of the Christian Association in
natural life).

If perchance the May Queen should
have a brother missing, she would know
that he could be prouder of her smiling
on that day than he would of many
weeds. Mourning is a right which has
been in many cases given up for unsel-
fish reasons. It knows no times nor sea-"

There seems to be no question in our
minds that, after we have done our aca-
demic work as well as possible, all our
best efforts should be centralized in war
work. We are to give up pleasures, en-
tertainments, spare time, and ill-spared
money, to make the war relief this winter
a success: But before we can do this,
we must be sure of our working basis.
If we are all working for the same end
we should all be on an equal footing.
Our central committee should be repre-
sentative. The workers should all have
equal rights and privileges. This is man-
ifestly impossible if the committee is un-
der any of the existing college organiza-
tions. It must be outside and above all
existing organizations. It must act as a
clearing house for the activities of these
organizations. It must co-ordinate every
individual or group enterprise with every
other, so that our unity of purpose may
not be lost in a heterogeneity of results.
The precedent for such organization is
already established. We have only to
look to the Woman’s Council for National
Defense to find a model for our working
basis. And once this is established, we
may be sure of success, for there can be
no question of our sincerity in the under-
taking.

BAVARIAN DIGGING-SONG FOUND IN
TRENCHES BEFORE VERDUN
One of the few enemy songs of the war
which has reached this country comes,
says the Literary Digest, “by the round-
about way of a dead man’s kit. A ‘Dig-
ging Song’ has been found written in the
diary of a Bavarian corporal named Sank-
tus, and was collected with other letters
and papers in German trenches before
Verdun.” Part of the poem, in rough
translation, gives an idea of the Bavarian
feeling for the Prussians:
“The gallant Bavarians—this is their
fate;
At every one’s pipe to be jigging;
While the lazy-boned Prussian reposes in
state,
The Bavarian’'s delving and digging;
He’s kept at it still—with no chance of
escape;
For there must be commands and there
must be red tape.”

ANOTHER BARRIER FALLS

Women are to sit in the jury box in
New York. ‘“‘Women jurors have become
a necessity, for the draft has diminished
to an alarming degree the men available
for jury duty,” says the Public Ledger,
quoting the New York Commissioner of
Jurors, Jacob Brenner.

Mr. Brenner expressed his opinion that
the State Legislature, at the coming ses-
sion, will give women the right to this
legal duty.

It is most encouraging to those of us
in France who see the College News to
learn through its columns of the earnest
patriotism at Bryn Mawr. The glorious
Liberty Loan campaign, the extensive or-
ganization of war committees, and the
general tone of college life seem to indi-

cate a determination to do the self-sacri-
ficing things, no matter how common-
place, that are necessary to win victory
and peace.

_ I should appreciate very much the op-
portunity to suggest that some share of
your gifts to war sufferers be given
through the Shurtleff war relief work
to the refugees of Paris. The needs of
those who have given not only their hus-
bands and brothers, but their homes and
often their little children, for their
country grow every day more appalling.
The families of the soldiers who are hold-
ing the trenches with indomitable cour-
age must be cared for.

The Shurtleff Committee, which has
been helping the refugees since the out-
break of the war with clothing, furniture,
and special aid of various sorts, is sup-
ported by gifts from America. Like many
of the committees in France it is allied
to the Red Cross in its work, but is finan-
cially independent. The large organiza-
tions must undertake the extensive work,
but for immediate pressing need the
smaller committees are indispensable. It
is therefore essential that these commit-
tees receive inereased aid as the need
becomes more acute.

Members of the committee go out in
pairs every day to climb the dark flights
of stairs and visit the people in their dis-
mal, crowded rooms; others interview
the families approved of and fit them out
with good second-hand American clothes
and shoes worth their weight in gold.
Still others buy the furniture and deliver
it in the little Ford truck. There is an
Ouvroir that gives work to about sixty
women, and a food department to build
up particularly run down families. In a
weekly conference problems are dis-
cussed, cases are approved, and special
cases assigned for medical care and
follow-up work; the thrilling stories of
adventure and escape lighten the atmos-
phere of misery and suffering.

The appeal of misery cannot be ig-
nored. If it is possible to send second-
hand clothing to those who come from
Germany suffering with the cold, if it is
possible by gifts of money to give beds
to the little children who are sleeping on
the Paris floors, the sacrifice and genér-
osity on your part will be greatly appre-
ciated.

The one thought in the mind of almost

hearing the inspiring address of Miss
Fraser was that we, the American women,
are not measuring up to the English
women. Why are we not more exten-
sively employed? What can we do?
Where will our services count the most?

These questions demand serious con-

sideration. We must remember that the

situation in the United States is quite
different from that in England. During
the first year of the war only a small
percentage of our men will be called into
military service. The vacancies so
created can be filled by a readjustment of

trade. The unskilled male worker at
present could be more profitably trained
to do this work. The government needs
skilled typists, trained nurses, physi-
cians, linguists, and accountants. Since
it takes both time and money to acquire
an education, and since those who have
a trained mind will be greatly in demand
in the future it is our duty to continue
our studies so, when the time comes, as
it probably will if war continues, we will
be able to take our places willingly and
intelligently in whatever capacity we are
needed."

For the benefit of those who do not
already know about the Service Corps, we
are grateful to the News for this oppor-
tunity to print again in its columns a
. brief explanation of the main war work
of the college for the year. The Service
Corps was the unanimous choice of a
mass meeting of the college community
because it combined, as no other object
did, the contribution of personal service
and of money. Moreover, though it offers
a wide field of service, it is still central-
ized enouzh to identify its workers with
Bryn Mawr College.

The aim of the Service Corps campaign
is a fund with which to support the work-
ers of the Corps. These will be individ-
uals chosen because of their previous
training and experience. They will be
placed at the disposal of relief organiza-
tions such as the Red Cross, the ¥. M.
C. A., the Friends’ Reconstruction, etc., to
be sent where most needed, and their ex-
penses will be paid out of the Fund.
Alumne already working abroad who are
in need of funds or financial support may
also draw on the Service Corps.

One of the obvious merits of this |
scheme is that it does not necessitate |
waiting until the entire sum is completed.
As soon as there is enough in the Fund
to support one worker she can enter the |
field.

The goal fixed for the college for this
academic year is $10,000. $4000 is to be
raised from the college as a whole and
~ $6000 from the classes, which means that
each individual is responsible for about
$15 apiece."

The Food Conservation Committee has
now held three meetings at which there
have been discussions as to the best and
most practical way in which members of
the college community can co-operate
with the Food Administration. It was
agreed that to eat three meals a day reg-
ularly, and only three, was the best way
to obtain the most nourishment with the
least waste. It was the sense of the
meeting that the committee is against
eating between meals, and _ therefore
against the selling of-any food on the
campus, on the ground that such selling
makes it easier to obtain food, and thus
tends to increase consumption. It was
moved and seconded that food should not
be sold for the benefit of the Service
Corps.

At the request of the undergraduate
members of the committee, the following
form of pledge is suggested:

“I hereby pledge myself to adhere
strictly to the regulations of the Food Ad-
ministration by observing Mondays and
Wednesdays as wheatless days, Tuesdays
as meatless, Saturdays as porkless, not
only at the three regular meals, but
throughout those days; and that further-
more I will eat as little as possible be-

NEWS STATEMENT CORRECTED
To the Editor of the College News:
May I correct the statement in The
News of last weék that “Miss Yasui, a
graduate of high school and normal
school in Tokyo, will be dean” of the
New Christian Women’s College?
I do not know whether she is a grad-
uate of high school or normal school, but
she could not be a graduate of both be-
cause they are of about the same stand-
ard. I know, however, that she is a
graduate of the higher normal school, in
Ocheno Mizu, Tokyo, which is above
either of them. She also studied twice
in England as a government scholar. She
was once a tutor of the royal family in
Siam, another time a teacher of the Peer-
esses’ School in Tokyo. She is one of
the foremost women in modern Japan.

WAR COURSES BEING FORMED AT
RED CROSS HEADQUARTERS



New Model Headquarters in Annex of
Lancaster Inn
The following War Courses will start at
the new model Red Cross. Headquarters
at the corner of Montgomery Avenue and
Morris Avenue as soon as ten or more
people register for each course.
Classes in Elementary Hygiene and
Home Nursing at the rate of $15 for fif-
teen lessons, in Dietetics at $10 for ten
lessons, in First Aid at $2.50 for ten les-
sons, in Surgical Dressings at $2 for seven
lessons, and an instructor’s course at $3
for seven lessons.
The Main Line Headquarters, which is
in the annex of the old Lancaster Inn, is
a model Red Cross workshop. Down-
stairs there is a large, well-lighted office,
of which Mrs. Henry Nevil Sanders is in
charge, a wool room, a cutting room, with
an electric cutting machine, and requisi-
tion and inspection rooms. Upstairs there
are two rooms for surgical dressings and
a sewing-room with seven electric sewing
machines. Two class rooms with hospital
beds and First Aid Charts occupy the
third floor.
As an example of the amount of busi-
ness transacted, Mrs. Sanders said that
$1200 worth of wool had been given out
in the last week. She pointed to the
padlocked doors partioning off a large
portion of the cellar, and said that they

In reply to your request for the higher
criticism, we would make the following
comments, however diffidently offered:

Though your publication could not be
expected to have the delicate abandon,
and the joie de vivre of its more polished
contemporary, still it might be hoped that
it would strive to emulate the suavity of
its elder sister. Instead of treating of
such esthetic experiences as the shadow
of the spoon on the cup, and the high
light on the green pea, you descend to
the vulgar trivialities of the War Council.
But perhaps an abortive effort to convey
something of the aroma of the tea-cup
which pervades the Little Publication in
the Yellow Cover exists, grossly ex-
pressed, in your advertisements of Mrs.
Miller’s. Your most striking weakness,
however, lies in your editorials. Refined
criticism can hardly be applied to efforts
which are characterized by such puerile
lucidity. Your readers, unlike ours,

Dear Editor:

Recently I heard that the Seniors, in
an effort to be economical, have given up
the idea of having a Class Record. I
should like to congratulate the class on
their spirit of unselfishness and to sug-
gest a possible substitute for the usual
expensive Record that might recommend
itself to classes even after the war.

Couldn’t the last edition of “Tipyn
O’Bob” this semester be made entirely a
Senior issue and be sold for a little more
than the ordinary copies in order to pay
for the extra expense? Could it not con-
tain pictures of the faculty and of the
Seniors, as well as Senior records?

This plan has been satisfactorily
adopted by the West Philadelphia High
School for Girls, where an attractive com-
mencement issue is sold for twenty-five
cents a copy.

If the Seniors are interested, they could
probably get a sample copy from a gradu-
ate of the West Philadelphia High School,
or I will send them one with pleasure.

It is always irritating to be told, in the
midst of a red-hot passion, to “look before
you leap”, but there is a very-much-to-the-
point-for-us moral in Miss Burke’s story
of the soldier who didn’t want to talk of
German atrocities because “I'll be so
damned mad-to-morrow. that I can’t aim
straight.” We all agree that our only
justification for being in the war lies in
the ends for which we are fighting. It

| certainly behooves us, then, to keep our

minds clear, not to be so damned mad
that we miss our aim. If our only feeling
for anything German is unqualified, unin-
telligent, impassioned hatred; if we con-

sarily mean being an Archangel, then, in
all seriousness, we are descending to the
level of nationalistic short-sightedness
which has made our enemies what they
are.

Every one of us must “carry on” with
every ounce of strength and faith and in-
telligence in us, but let us do it in our
various ways because we have thought
and are sure that those ways will be ulti-

of which the keynote is “Can the Kaiser”.

Fines to the amount of $28 go to the

convenience of the comparatively few |
who already have summer jobs is not a
sufficient reason for the inconvenience to
the majority of us which closing the Col-
lege three days early would entail. But
it is not on practical reasons that our ar-
gument is based: we are agitating the
question of three idle days, at the end
of the term not because those particular
days are important in themselves, but be-
cause a decision concerning them is in-
dicative of the College attitude.

The excellent peace-time principles of
convenience and pleasure and the estab-
lished order have played too large a part
in our motives. When comfortably de-
ciding what we want, I wonder if it ever
occurs to us that we can still do so only
because women in England and France
have not stopped to consider what they
wanted for three and a half years? We
need to wake up. And the College should
not encourage our lethargy by presenting
us with three days to waste. Of course,
multiplied by the six hundred or so mem-
bers of the College community they
mount up to 1800 potential working days,
which seems a good deal. But supposing
not one of us did a stroke of work in
those three days, that would not be the
College's affair.

The College’s affair is not only to re-
frain from preventing our getting to
work, but, in the capacity of our Gracious
Inspiration, to help knock it into our
heads that the only thing for us to do is
to get to work as soon as possible.

A great deal has been said about Bates
House this year, and as a whole we have
shown enthusiasm and appreciation, but
merely giving money is not enough, The
College has undertaken to support Bates
with workers as well as with money. So
far not nearly enough workers have
signed up. We need four a week.

Miss Deems, at a great sacrifice is giv-
ing up a fine “war job” abroad to be head
of Bates House this summer. When we
hear from Spring Street Settlement how
much it means to the children, especially
after the hard winter, to spend some of
the hot weather at Long Branch, we
ought to rearrange summer plans if nec-
essary, so as to spend some time at
Bates House. We can, moreover, do a
direct war service by helping the factory
and business girls to a clearer view of the
principles involved in the war.

If we lose personal contact with Bates
House this summer it will be very hard
to take it up next year. Though we may
feel we can do more real war work on
a farm, or in a hospital or in some ca-
pacity at Washington, still there can be
no place where our work will count for
more or be more appreciated. One week
out of four months’ vacation does not
seem much to ask.

Contrary to the French proverb, “Ce

comparatively easy to begin anything, but
hard to become perfect, said Dr. Soares.
The proverb should be, “You must not
fail now; it will be harder later.”

Dr. Soares pointed out a common fail-

overestimate the difficulty of the tasks
of today, and underestimate their impor-

BRYN MAWR DINNER
UNDER BOMBARDMENT
Paris Workers Have Reunion

(Written for the College News by E.

Several Bryn Mawr graduates, taking
refuge during a recent German attempt
to raid Paris, planned a dinner, which
was held on April Ist. About forty Bryn
Mawr workers in France, whose ad-
dresses were obtainable, were sent no-
tices.

Shells were still falling in the city
when the nine who were able to be pres-

talk over the different works they were
engaged in and to sing college songs. The
most recent number of the College News
was read and there was some discussion
of the Service Corps, which all at the
dinner seemed to favor.

Some of the alumnz had been working
at a temporary canteen for refugees pass-

tlefield. They came to the dinner be-

if we can obtain loans of $100, which can
in all probability be repaid in full before
the first of January, 1919. Gifts of
smaller amounts will, however, be very
gratefully accepted. The Alumnewe Com-

CRYING NEED FOR WOMEN DOCTORS



Asks Undergraduates to Consider Going
into Medicine

As “a challenge to the fighting spirit”
of girls debating whether they ought to
take up the study of medicine or nursing,
Dr. Ellen Potter, who gave the Social
Hygiene course this spring, has for-
warded to Bryn Mawr an editorial by Dr.
Martha Tracy '98, Dean of the Women’s
Medical College of Pennsylvania, printed
in the Evening Ledger for May 4th.

“I am oppressed by a growing and pain-
ful sense of the unwillingness of educated
women, college women, to undertake
work for their country which involves
long-continued effort, daily sacrifice, a
giving of service fully and completely to
the end of the war and thereafter,” Dr.
Tracy writes. “‘A four years’
training is too long,’ they cry. ‘We want
to serve now.’ And they let the smaller
present opportunity conceal the future
field immeasurably wider.

“At this moment the hospitals in the
city lack by 50 per cent the normal staff
of resident doctors, the shortage of
nurses is serious, and dispensaries have
been closed.

“At the Wothen’s Medical College ap-
proximately thirty women are applying
for entrance next fall. There should be

“College women, others can make Red
Cross dressings and fill shells. You only
can fill the ranks of physicians and
nurses!”



DR. MUTCH EXPLAINS WAR CHEST

“Our army is one in the spirit of patri-
otism and service and the nation back of
it should be one in supplying its needs,”
said Dr. Mutch in explaining the War
Chest method of raising money, last
Thursday morning in Chapel.

Instead of the different organizations
for making separate drives, the appeals
for all war relief will be combined into
one intensive effort of filling the war
chest. A board of directors will decide as
to the division of the money. This plan
will save time and money, work and over-"

When I came to reunion last June, the
one blot on the landscape was the bulle-
tin boards. They were bad when I was
in college and they are no better now,
and have not kept pace with other im-
provements apparent right and left. Now
the solution has come to me, after a good
deal of worry, and I am planning to try it
out in a bandage factory where I am do-
ing “efficiency” (loathesome word) work
for the duration of the war.

The idea is this: Conceive of the bul-
letin boards as a newspaper published at
regular intervals, say daily, twice a week,
or weekly. Make the board as readable
as a newspaper would have to be. Put
everything in concise headline or news-
paper form; have definite spacing for cer-
tain classified news, announcements, or
advertising of interest to campus read-
ers; banish all items that are out of date.

Further developments I leave to you.
I should aim at clearness of arrangement,
brevity and pithiness of style, originality,
balance, and order. Announcements
should not be tacked on top of each other,
or by one corner, so that they flutter in
the passing breeze.

As to organization, I should suggest
that the bulletin boards be taken over by
the College News, who shall run them in
conjunction with their regular sheet,
which we all look forward to receiving.

In the factory, conditions are a little
different, and we have definitely aban-
doned the idea of a shop newspaper. The
bulletin boards are to take the place of a
weekly printed sheet. In college they
could supplement and feed the College
News. I do not know just how your or-
ganization works, but I presume that you
have a representative in each hall. This
girl could very properly undertake to
manipulate the bulletin board in her own
hall. She, ex-officio, keeps in touch with
things brewing and doing, and must have
journalistic ability and experience. She
can run the bulletin board like the boards
outside of newspaper offices, not forget-
ting to keep the bulletin board needs of
the college in general as important as
those of the News in particular.

I do not anticipate any difficulty in tak-
ing over the care of the bulletin boards
from the present managers. In my day, I
think, it formed a minor—a very minor—
department of the Undergraduate Asso-
ciation, but it never reached its highest
possibilities then or now. It is a big, big
asset going to waste.

I should be very glad to hear the News
had carried out my suggestion, and shall
be very glad to help the managing board
further, if they decide to undertake the
matter. With all good wishes,

Marjorie Young 1908.

Service Corps when he spoke at college
last May, was unable to go with the Per-
sian Commission. A sixth new worker,
Rosalie James ’03, sails this month.

In all $26,780.96 has been received for
the Service Corps, according to Miss Di-
mon, of the Service Corps Executive Com-
mittee. $15,979.96 has been raised by the
Alumne, and $10,518.48 by the college
War Council. $16,000 of this has already
been paid out and $9000 more appropri-
ated.

The thirteen workers on the Service
Corps are: Elizabeth Sergeant ’03, inves-

WRITES OF WORK IN Y. M. C. A.
CANTEEN



B. M. Service Corps Member at La
Courtine

One of the workers whom Bryn Mawr
is supporting in France, Laura Hatch, has
written to Miss Dimon telling of the Y. M.
C. A. canteen work she is doing. She
Says in part:

“In Paris we had our first first-hand
experience with the Hun. In the six
nights that we were there we had four
air-raids. Two of them were really very
severe, the one on June 27th being the
worst they had had for a long time. One
bomb fell within a couple of blocks of our
hotel, but fortunately fell in the street,
and no one was hurt.

“It is really quite an experience to hear
the sirens give the ‘alerte.’ Then all the
new people in town run down to the cel-
lars on the first floors of houses, and the
old inhabitants just turn over with a sigh,
and go to sleep again. I was so curious
that I hated to go below. The second
night I viewed the raid from the shelter
of the arcade. The play of the search-
lights searching the sky fot the raiders,
and the bursting of the shells sent up by
the anti-aircraft guns, was most interest-
ing.

“This place, La Courtine, is right in the
center of France, almost. We can tell
where we are in this zone (service of
supplies) as it is neither at the front nor
on the coast. I’m glad, too, because then
I can tell you more about things. The
country is lovely, is high (2200 feet) and
the air clean and cool.

“The canteen here is a large one and
has seven workers. The temporary
buildings are now being completed, with
a writing room in one and a billiard room
in another, which will help a little and
relieve the congestion in our room.

“We are luxuriously housed (that is,



for canteen workers) in a hotel about a

One of our biggest problems this year
is how to pass the traditions of Self-Gov-
ernment on to the Freshman Class. Since
the quarantine has prevented our having
the annual meeting in the “first fort-
night,” the responsibility of instilling into
the incoming class our spirit toward Self-
Government is left entirely with the Up-
perclassmen and Sophomores. Unless
every one of us realizes our personal re-
sponsibility it will be impossible to main-
tain the high ideals for which our organi-
zation has always stood. After all it is
our own organiaztion and its future rests
with us.

Sarah C. Taylor ’19,

President of Self-Government.

To the Editor of the College News:

In the cheerful hope of relaxation in
the War Council last
Monday made further recommendations
to a mass-meeting-to-be. Owing to the
form of the motion made last winter, in
which the Service Corps project was ac-
cepted for the year only, it is necessary
this year to vote again on the main war
object of the college. Our obligations to
the organizations under whom our work-
ers are serving overseas, and to the work-
ers themselves, need no discussion.

The War Council has decided to recom-
mend, as the method of raising Service
Corps funds in college, a quota system of
$8500 for the first semester, described in
detail on the same page of this issue of
the News. The system of assigning a
given sum to be raised by a given class
in a given time was felt to have stood
the test of previous usage, and to place
the project on a thoroughly business-like
basis.

In dividing the sum to be raised into
class allotments, the question of the
amount of the per capita pledge arose.
While the quota may, by a good mathe-
matician, be resolved into an individual
allotment of $16 for the first semester,
the feeling of the War Council is directly
opposed to pressure on the individual for
a given sum. Those who are able will
probably give more than $16, those who
are not are perfectly justified in giving
less. If it is proved that the balance can-
not be maintained in this way, it is up to
us all as a body to work our hardest to
make up the deficit. We can do no more.

The importance of- our financial cam-
paign for this year, and of the intelligent
vote on it demands the attention of all.
It is not too much to say that the purpose
of every individual in college in regard
to campaigns for war relief is the same.
If there are differences in opinion as to
the means to attain the end, it is the re-
sponsibility of everyone in college to find
out the actual facts of the case, through
News statements, or by talking to War
Counell members, cast a vote about which
they have really thought, and then abide
by the decision of the majority.

that it is, to say the least, disconcerting

to be forced in the midst of it to listen to

the technical explanation of a new quiz

happened to the Seniors last week.

There has been a good deal of indigna-

explanation was made, and many stu-
dents feel that their chances of passing
were materially lessened by the persistent
interruptions. Aside from the ordinary

SECOND BRITISH SCHOLAR ARRIVES
IN BRYN MAWR —



Crossed on Boat with Ex-Ambassador
Page

A second British scholar has arrived in
Bryn Mawr from Scotland, Miss Grace
Dedman, M.A. Edinburgh University, with
Honours in English.

Miss Dedman was delayed in securing
passage and it was feared she might not
be able to get here. For the present she
is living in Denbigh. The other British
scholar, Miss Helen Wilkie, arrived at
the first of the year. She and Miss Ded-
man were classmates at the University
of Edinburgh.

Tells of Ocean Passage
Miss Dedman crossed on the boat with
Dr. Page, recent American Ambassador to
England. The passage as it is now made,

-according to both Miss Dedman and Miss

Wilkie, is about one thousand miles
longer, because the vessels tack, turning
at unexpected intervals in order to run
out of the range of any U-boat aim. The
boats are camouflaged, as are all ocean
liners.

The régime on shipboard is strictly
military, with bugles for rising, bugles
for dressing and eating and special bugle
calls for life-drill. Four soldiers assigned
to every boat assisted first women with
children, then all other women, and last
the men, to enter the lifeboats as quickly
as possible. One boat, Miss Dedman said,
carried twenty children, American or Ca-
nadian, born in England after 1914, whose
fathers had been killed or else were in
action.

Machine Guns Train on Iceberg

The passengers were always under the
command of the officers, who ordered
them to wear their life-belts at all times,
except during meals. The boat passed
two transports—one bringing English
soldiers from France and another carry-
ing American soldiers overseas.

“Our machine guns took aim and prac-
ticed fire on a large iceberg some three
miles distant. We could see the chips
sliding off,” said Miss Wilkie. The pas-
sage was particularly safe because of the
high sea, in which no U-boat can live.



Seeing America First

Shut off from the outside world, two
members of 1920 are determined to have
“every experience a woman can have” on
the campus. L. Sloane and M. Porritt are
making a tour of the campus, dining at a
different table in one of the five halls
every evening.

mass: meeting. . :
Last year $10,000 was raised between



rt wale aclinied the War teanall GIGI

Monday night. After a careful discussion
the lower sum was accepted, and will be
submitted to the vote of the college at a

February and May. The feeling of the
War Council seemed to be that the cok
lege should on no account relax its
money-raising efforts, but that, since the
semester is already well advanced and no
rallies or metings can be held for some
time ahead, it is better to set the college’s
quota at the lower figure. |

The Alumnez are becoming more and
more enthusiastic about the Service
Corps, .Miss Martha Thomas reported.
The Red Cross, the Y. M. C. A., and other
organizations have shown that they will
accept any woman the Service Corps
Committee recommends. Miss Marion
Reilly, chairman of the Service Corps
Committee, has recently been made chair-
man of the personnel department of the
Y. M. C. A. for this district, and has
charge of the selection of Y. M. C. A.
canteen workers.

Extra Members of War Council
Committee

Various committee members besides
those elected by the four classes were
approved. Members on the Liberty Loan
Department are Mr. Hurst, Comptroller
of the College, Mrs. Chandler, and Miss
Goldstein and Miss Babcock, graduate
students.

Dean Maddison is an honorary member
of the Educational Department and the
presidents of the clubs and chairmen of
the Religious Meetings and Social Serv-
ice Committees will constitute an ad-
visory committee.

The regular members of the depart-
ment have not yet been elected by the
classes. By a new scheme each class will
be asked to send a representative to fill a
specific office on the committee in ques-
tion. The plan for the offices the differ-
ent classes will fill is:

Events of the past few days have led
us to believe that the Sophomores are tou

much impressed with the dignity of their

own position. While we have long since
tearned to consider our crackers and jam
as community property, we should like, if
possible, to keep our hats, desks, rugs,
and pictures for our own use. In con-
scription days, when time is no longer
our,own, may we not pursue our Sunday
meditations free from the intrusion of
cude appraisers? If this is the Sopho-
more idea of courtesy, who are they to
vote the Freshmen fresh?

To the Editor of the College News:

From several sources we have heard
that the action of certain members of our
class in trying to secure properties for
the Sophomore dance has offended some
of those whose rooms were entered last
Sunday. As the thoughtlessness of this
procedure was not realized at the time,
we wish to alopogize for our uninten-
tional rudeness.

The Class of 1921.
Per E. H. M., Sec’y.



To the Editor of the College News:

This year it is proposed to inaugurate
a new scheme for raising the money nec-
essary to run Bates House. The custom
has been for the Christian Association to
raise two-thirds of the required sum on
the budget and to depend on a private
canvass by the committee for the re-
mainder. Last year the Christian Asso-
ciation gave us $1000 and we raised $500
by our spring pledges. It seems logical
to include in the budget drive all the
money for Bates House, thereby connect-
ing more closely the activities of the com-
mittee with the Association.

We hope to raise $1500 on the budget
by pledges in November. To do this, it is
necessary for all to realize in pledging
that to avoid the canvass in the spring
and to insure to Bates House the success
it has enjoyed this past summer, they
must pledge at least twice .the usual
sum.

Frances C. Clarke,
Chairman of the Bates House Com.

To the Editor of the College News:

Is there something wrong with the col-
lege or something wrong with us? It is
impossible to hear, day after day, “The
most patriotic thing you can do is to stay
at college, and prepare yourself for recon-
struction work after you graduate,” and
not to think there is something in it.

Yet as we read of our friends dying at
the front, it is hard to believe that we
are doing the most we can—going to our
classes, eating when we are hungry,
sleeping when we are sleepy, having
thrills over hockey matches, and revelling
in the extreme patriotism of our “mili-
tary” drills.

There is, of course, Red Cross work to
do, and some people do it—but many do

not, because naturally they cannot neg-|.

lect their committee meetings and song-
practices—it -would be lacking in college
spirit. The Conscription Board allows
such occupations (not to mention rehears-



abou tee the Soglees €F calmed ead tec

excellent distribution of time thereat?
Moreover, if exercise and studying are

so regulated as to make us better, phys-

is | ically as well as mentally, why is it that |

| at Que wad ak the willbe oar the wale

ity of people are below par?

Why have half-way measures? To my
mind there is little use in waving your
arms around vacantly for ten minutes
twice a week, or in having a show-off drill

on the hockey field so that neighbors may

see how patriotic is our Alma Mater.
Some retort courteously, “But drill is for
physical development.” Judging by last
week’s performance, I should say they
are quite right if the purpose is the de-
velopment of the larynx.

If, instead of this, we had some vain
military discipline, and went about it se-
viously, we might consider ourselves as
doing something. College work should be
war work, and all irrelevant practices»
should be abolished. This sounds like the
Prussian system, you say? The differ-
ence is merely that should this measure
go through, it would be by vote of the
majority: the minority would be con-
trolled by public opinion.

If we are going to college at all, we
ought to give at least our time, when
others are giving their lives, to the
country. It makes no difference what
sort of war work we are planning to do—
whether reconstructing French’ villages,
or assisting in a laboratory—but we must
have some definite idea and plan our
courses accordingly. Why cannot we be
a military college, and not join the ranks
of those who seem not to be slackers,
but who an reality are: people who are
just drifting. If we find that we are
drifting we ought to get out!

In agswer to the argument that mili-
tary discipline would weaken our will
power and make us puppets, the fact re-
mains that those who have that estimable
characteristic are living up to those
standards anyway, and as for the others
—it might wake them up a little bit so
that even if they are mental wrecks they
won't be physical wrecks!

We think we’d hate it! Supposing we
did? If we are going to get out of doing
the things we hate by coming to college,
Bryn Mawr would be better without us
in war time! If war disciplines the men,
why not the women who are to try to
take their places?

Minor Latin, Social Hygiene, and the en-

without a quiver, the facts of life. But
references to the aforementioned facts,
and the detailed court records of the an-
tics of the underworld, given in a course
in “Civilian Relief,” are absolutely unnec-
essary and irrelevant and can but arouse
our indignation.

THE BIBLE A LIVING BOOK

Dr. Wood's First Lecture Enthusiastically
Attended —

“Bible Study for Busy People,” the first
lecture by Dr. Charles Wood of Washing-
ton, was finally given last Wednesday
after being postponed from the week be-
fore on account of the epidemic.

“Some people have an interest in the
Bible as collectors,”, said Dr. Wood;
“others as a piece of good literature and
have read it through many times without
ever getting the true message.” We need
more than a bowing acquaintance with
the Bible, he continued, We need a
knowledge that comes from reading it
thoughtfully every day. The most inter-
esting thing about life is living and yet
some people are so busy that they do not
live. If they really want to live, the Bible
is the book that gives light and life.

RESPECT FOR PERSONALITY IS
STANDARD OF TRUE CHRISTIANITY



E. Biddle, President of C. A., Tells Large
Audience at Vespers

“*Love one another,’ should be the
keynote of our lives in college, in the
community and in America this year,”
said Elizabeth Biddle, president of the
Christian Association, last Sunday in
vespers. “But that doctrine has been
preached so much and practised so little
that we might do better to say, ‘Have re-
spect for personality.’ Develop your own
according to your ideals and give the
same opportunity to others. Put the good
and the personality of others above your
own selfishness. If everyone put this into
practise it would be impossible for eight
hundred schools in New York to be closed
because of a lack of teachers or for an
industrial leader to say that he used up
one batch of men and then got a new one.
If we had love for one another we should
have a world safe for democracy or, in
other words, the kingdom of God. This
is subject to criticism as being idealistic

‘and unpractical. Live by it and see if

it is. The job is bigger than we are and
therefore it is thrilling.”

FRENCH LECTURE SATURDAY

A lecture on “Americans in France”

It appears that Arnold Bennett —is
right. Who, by this time, is not aware of
the fact that she is a “human machine”
and that she knows little of the art of

M. Cestre Opens Course at the Sorbonne

A course in American Literature and
Civilization has just been instituted at
the Sorbonne under Professor Charles
Cestre, head of the English Department
at Bordeaux, who lectured at Bryn Mawr
last spring on English Poetry. The pur-
pose of the course, according to the New
York Times, is to promote in the sphere
of intellectual interests the same close
and cordial relations between France and
the United States that are now binding
the two republics in other ways.

M. Cestre, who was last year’s Ex-
change Professor to Harvard, has made
several tours of the United States as offi-
celal lecturer of l’Alliance Francaise. He
received a diploma from Harvard in 1897,
having come there from the Sorbonne to
take advantage of the English Depart-
ment.

VARSITY ORCHESTRA FORMED



Has Nineteen Pieces

Through the initiative of H. Huntting
""19 a Varsity Orchestra has been assem-
bled and will soon be fully organized
along the same lines as the Glee Club.

The Orchestra made its debut Satur-
day evening at the Social Service Party.
It will play at college events throughout
the year and is to have regular orches-
trated scores of music.

At a meeting some time this week a di-
rector, a manager and a treasurer will
be elected.

The nineteen pieces of the orchesira,
chosen from tryouts held last week, are:

KNITTING MACHINES NEGLECTED



The knitting machines have been idle
for want of workers, reports M. Janeway

Walton’s absence. From the beginning of
college up to last Saturday only twenty
pairs of socks had been-turned out. Two
machines had been ready for use for six-

allowance of one pair a night on each
machine, forty-seven pair should have
been completed.

“NO ADMITTANCE” TO PEMBROKE



Pembroke West boasts a maid who
rigidly enforces the quarantine rule for-

one case, however, her efforts were un-
successful. Last week she attempted
grimly to turn away an aunt who called
to see her niece. The “outsider” was the

the ‘Federal Amendment, which is still: in
the balance. Hither Dr. Anna Howard
Shaw or Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt will
be asked to address the club on the sub-
ject of the Amendment, and it is probable
that a suffrage carnival, on the order of
the political rally of two years ago, will
be held in the gymnasium.

The Suffrage Club was enabled by the
kindness of President Thomas to distrib-
ute copies of President Wilson’s speech
on Suffrage among the students.

The News of October 10th printed a
statement by Z. Boynton, president, to
the effect that the club would either be
converted into a civics club for the in-
struction of voters or would be abolished

The desire of the undergraduates that

The proposed change would involve an

One thing gleaned from the Cabinet
Conference of the C. A. with other col-
leges was, I think, the fact that other col-
leges seemed to possess more Christian
intelligence than we have at Bryn Mawr.
Their classes and meetings seem to be
planned and worked out with a definite
purpose in view and an intellectual grasp
of modern religious thought. This may
be partly due to the Faculty interest in
other colleges which would bring another
point of view into their associations. But
whatever the reason, couldn’t we develop
to some extent this more educational side
of the C. A. instead of the somewhat hit-
or-miss classes and meetings under the
present system?

SCORN NOT THE SONNET

Since the very souls of the members of
the Second Year English Class have been
laid bare by the compulsory composition
of sonnets, we have entered upon a new
realization of the almost universal mor-
bid-mindedness of our friends. Girls who
before seemed gay even to a point of friv-
olity are now seen in their true colors:
“clothed in the sabler tints of woe.”

The company commander and orchestra
leader, who poured forth her feelings on
Revenge, will never more be misunder-
stood; though she assume a mask of
mirth, even approaching raucous jollity,
it will never be forgotten that beneath
this smiling exterior is concealed an in-
ner being of Byronic bitterness. “Die,
thou beast!” says she magnificently (re-
ferring to the Kaiser, of course—and em-
boldened by the “clarion blast” of Peace,
referred to in a previous line). What a
relief it must have been for her thus to
vent her splendid inclination.

One of less sanguine temperament
chooses Friendship as best expressing
her personality. Even she, however, is
not untainted by the cynicism of the day:

“Although the fangs of jealousy extend
And like a rodent when his prey he
brings
Into his lair and soon aside it flings,
Then gnaws again—they gnaw our faith,
my friends.”

One feels that this writer may have
been a bit unfortunate in the selection of
her comrades.

‘Even our veteran campus insurance
broker has assumed a new aspect. Who
would have guessed that under her blue
gym suit there throbbed a sorrowing
heart; that above her apparently prac-

And that I’m here I asservate* I'm glad.

And while this great round ball is clad
in green

It has an antic grace, a lovely sheen.

So while I can before it is too late

I'll live my life and leave the rest to

STUDENTS IN UNIVERSITIES OF
FRANCE AND SWITZERLAND
HELPED BY BRYN MAWR
CONTRIBUTIONS

An account of work among the students
of foreign universities, to which Bryn
Mawr has been contributing, has been
sent to the college by Miss Ruth Rouse,
travelling secretary of the World’s Stu-
dent Christian Federation. She writes:

“I know that at Bryn Mawr, as in all
the American colleges, the girls are
deeply interested in war work. You will
easily see, I think, that what the World’s
Student Christian Federation is doing in
various countries in Europe has a vital
bearing on war problems, and especially
in preparing for the work of reconstruc-
tion in some of the countries which have
been devastated, notably in the Balkans
and in Belgium. I am sending
you two special reports, one on the work
in Geneva and the other about. the
women’s student conference at MAlons,
in France.

Many Foyers for French Students

“FRANCE. The French Student Move-;
ment has passed through deep waters
this year. Their travelling secretary,
Monsieur Charies Grauss, was killed at
the front in August, and the Serbian sec-
retary, Monsieur Jovitchitch, appointed
for special work amongst the Serbian stu-
dents, died in June.

“The women’s work, however; has
made marked progress. Next year they
hope to have two or three conferences,
such as the one at MAlons, in different
parts of the country. Foyers are in full
working order in Paris, Lyons, Montpel-
lier and Toulouse. In each of these there
is a secretary, giving her time to the
work of the foyer and the Student Chris-
tian Association. In Paris there are two
secretaries. The Toulouse foyer is the
latest addition. In Paris, thanks to gen-
erous help from America, we have been
able to open the longed-for hostel for
women students in the Latin quarter. It
is to hold fifty students.

“In contrast to the work in the past,
the large majority of the. students
touched by our work are French. But
this is because we have gained ground
amongst the French, not because we
have lost it amongst the foreign stu-
dents. I think it is not too much to say
that practically every Serbian woman stu-
dent studying in the French universities
today is in close touch with the French
Student Christian Movement. We had
hoped to have the same close tie with
the men, but the death of M. Jovitchitch
has hindered the fulfilment of our dream.

Open Hostel in Geneva

“SWITZERLAND. As you will see
from the report from Geneva, this year
has been a year of progress. The Hostel
has been started, and already enlarged,
the Foyer has moved into new and larger
quarters, a Bureau de Traveil has been
begun, and has proved a great success,
doing away largely with the need for
monetary help for students. A summer
house for students has also been run
throughout the summer vacation.

OUTSIDE WORKERS TELL OF RED
CROSS AT HOME AND ABROAD

The work of the Red Cross at home and
abroad was pictured in the Red Cross
workroom in Merion last Thursday by
Mrs. Ewing, head of the Reclamation De-
partment of the Main Line branch of the
Red Cross, and her sister, Miss Dewey, a
navy nurse just returned from foreign
service, .

Mrs. Ewing described the shortage in
new uniform underwear which makes the
Red Cross mending so important just
now. Workers are falling off, she said,
but the present allotment of garments to
the Main Line must be finished very soon,
If more garments than are needed by our
soldiers are mended, they will be sent to
refugees abroad.

A Carmelite nunnery at Brest, to which
men from torpedoed boats were brought,
was the scene of much of Miss Dewey’s
work abroad. Sick men often had to
leave their beds to make room for more
desperate cases, the congestion was so
great. Miss Dewey had been near Sois-
sons and Chateau-Thierry last’ summer,
and said that in every emergency the Red
Cross had provided for all wants of both
patients and nurses with more prompt-
ness than could have been hoped for.

IAN HAY’S LECTURE
(Continued from page 1.)

While in England last summer, Major
Beith directed the sending of British
speakers to this country, and headed the
committee for the reception of American
delegations to England. He is now at
work on a book called The Last. Million,
describing the American soldiers’ point of
view regarding the “oddities“ of Great
Britain.

A dramatization by Major Beith of his
novel, Happy-Go-Lucky, will be presented
in London this spring.



Major Beith’s Forecast Fulfilled—
A. E. F. Can Spend Leave in England

The hope expressed last Saturday by
Major Beith that American soldiers would
soon be allowed to spend their leaves in
England, is to be realized this week, ac-
cording to an article in The New York
Times. The United States Government
has granted the request of Great Britain
that England and Scotland be included
in the leave area, and soldiers are ex-
pected to arrive at the rate of one hun-
dred and fifty a day.

Many English homes, according to.
Major Beith, will be opened to the Ameri-
cans. Rest stations have been estab-
lished at Stratford-on-Avon and Edin-
burgh.

Is there anything we can do to per-
suade Required Physical Exercise to get
on a basis that seems sensible and agree-
able? Every healthy, able-bodied person
wants exercise; but most of us resent
being forced to do certain, definite, set
things without seeing any rational pur-
pose. It is not less strenuous recreation
that we desire; but less red tape, less
formality, more real, vital, energetic ac-
tivity.

The present system of signing up four
periods of “organized exercise,” and of
always taking these in an exact, specified
costume, seems a great waste of time and
energy. Why is it of more physical value
to be forever putting on gym-suit, gym-
shoes, hockey-skirt, middy, what-not, ar-
riving at certain place on campus at
whatever hour is convenient to hall-
captain (once a Monday drill was not an-
nounced until Tuesday, and yet we were
held responsible), flinging arms about,
walking around in squads, spasmodically
bowing to the earth, being bored to death
for thirty minutes, and finally going back
and getting rid of hockey-skirt, middy,
etc.,—why is this, we say, of greater ad-
vantage than forty-five minutes or an
hour of vigorous outdoor skating?

But why not skate if you want to? No-
body is keeping you from skating. If you
are so fond of vigorous exercise, skate as
much as you like in addition!! This
sounds quite beautiful from one point of
view; but unfortunately Bryn Mawr is
not yet primarily a physical culture insti-
tution. Once in a while we have to go to
the lib., once in a while we must turn up
at a class, once in a while we have to dis-
sect a frog or find our color sensitivity.
If we register four “organized” periods a
week—when can we do real exercise?

JUNIOR PROMENADE AT é
BRYN MAWR GREAT SUCCESS

Pembroke Decorated in Novel Way

Twenty years ago this month Bryn
Mawr’s first and last Junior Promenade
was solemnized in Pembroke. The form
of entertainment was restricted to con-
versation to slow music; there was no
dancing.

The guests, snowbound for nearly a
week, were entertained by concerts and
teas.

“Chronologically the concert of the Glee
and Banjo Clubs was the first of all the
events, coming on Friday evening, Feb.
10,” says the Fortnightly Philistine for
Feb. 24, 1899. “Great praise is due to the
members, and more especially even to the
leaders of both clubs, for the entertain-
ment on account of its success musically
and also because enjoyment was shared
by mankind in general and not limited to
the students of the college.

Basketball Game a Feature

“The basketball game on Saturday
morning, between the classes of odd and
even numbers, though rather amusing to
Bryn Mawrters whose sense of propriety
is outraged at seeing centres throw goals,
was, considering circumstances, well
played. The Sophomore breakfast and
Junior and Senior teas followed close
upon one another and rather seemed
parts of one continuous performance than
distinct social events.

“The Promenade was conducted with-
out a flaw, and if only it was as enjoyable
from the point of view of outsiders as
from that of ‘insiders,’ the Junior Class
can pat itself upon the head and whisper
in its own ear, ‘Well done.’ The experi-
ence which the Pembroke dining-room
must have experienced on Saturday night
was certainly most becoming to it. .
To remove the necessity of gazing the
entire evening upon the same laurel fes-
toons, however pretty they might be, a
Japanese room and a Dutch room had
been fitted up where wearied pedestrians
could rest for a small fraction of an hour.
It was much whispered about that some
people present would have been very
glad to vary the form of exercise, but for-
tunately the music was solemn and slow
enough to remove all temptations.”

The Milestone of the Community Cen-
ter has grown so in the past year that
we are trying to furnish two girls’ club
rooms and extend the library. For the
club rooms we want pictures, ornaments,
chairs (especially comfortable ones), pil-
lows (the covering does not matter), and
sheet-music.

In the library. reference books are es-
pecially needed. The public school has a
very inadequate supply, and so the boys
and girls come to the center to try to
find their material, which unfortunately
we ave often unable to furnish.

Surely most of you have one of these
things which you could spare. Please
give all contributions which you may
have to the junk representative in your
hall. We hope very much that the fac-



ulty will also be interested in helping us.
Anything may be left at the Milestone or
Rockefeller or if this is not convenient
Jet us know and “we will call.”

Edith Rondinella,

Poetry and Review High Water Mark

Poetry, always the redeeming feature
ot Tipyn o’ Bob, ranks first again in the
contributions to the Review. The most
outstanding, a sonnet by Victoria Evans

‘21, with its sympathetic picture of old_

and young warriors, is unusually vivid.
The little poem by Laura Hales ’20 has
originality in form and thought. “Foreign
Finesse,” by Alice Harrison, is distin-
guished by its originality of theme and
clever ending.

The prose article of most literary worth
is certainly the Keen review of Eminent
Victorians, by Eleanor Cooper ‘19. Jean
Flexner '21 also gives a skillful review of
two recent plays. The long list of newly
yublished books, not owned by the col-
lege, seems hardly worth printing.

Magazine Representative, but Slender

The contributions are fairly representa-
tive of the college, easily saving the
Review from the reproach of being writ-
ten exclusively by the editors. A new
and interesting field is offered to the
casual contributor in the stories about
foreign lands.

The slimness of the first number is
disappointing. It is scarcely larger than
Tip, which forgot to grow when it
changed from a fortnightly to a monthly
publication. Perhaps the realization that
the table of contents includes article of
interest to everyone, will stimulate more
contributors.

NEARBY TOWNS PLAN COMMUNITY
CENTERS AS SOLDIERS’
MEMORIALS



The movement sweeping over the whole
country to help communities to “manage
themselves” is well represented in sev-
eral towns which are Bryn Mawr’s near
neighbors, Dr. Susan M. Kingsbury
stated in chapel last Wednesday. In the
town of Marietta a community house and
grounds have been given as a soldiers’
memorial and the town itself has raised
$35,000, $25,000 of which will be used as
an endowment and $10,000 for a gymna-
sium and swimming pool.

In Garrett Hill, not far from here, the
school building is to be purchased for a
community house, Preston also wants its
eading room developed into a community
hause and has asked the Bryn Mawr
Community Center to supervise it.

Dr. Kingsbury called attention to two
bills now before Congress: one for the
continuation of the United States Em-
ployment Service; the other, providing
that the two commissions organized
under the Department of Labor, a com-
mission on housing and a commission on
living conditions, be united and made
permanent, The defeat of either of these,
she declared, would be “a national ca-
lamity.”



Would Have Special Style of Poetry to
Represent Bryn Mawr

Various forms of versification and the
possibilities of producing here some sort
of poetry that would belong especially to
Bryn Mawr and college days were dis-
cussed by the Reelers and Writhers Club
at a meeting in K. Ward’s room last
Thursday. Each member present read

‘The portraits Miss King declared to be

far and away the most interesting part of
the exhibition. She mentioned particu-
larly the “sound, serious, and thoroughly
laudable” picture of Miss Hillard, by
Lydia Field Emmett, and the painting of
Edward T. Stotesbury by R. L, Parting-
ton, “Mr. Stotesbury’s portrait,” said

Miss King, “gives a type; presents a suc-
cessful American business man, and af.-
fords perhaps a glimpse into the most
notorious system in the United States.”

The portrait of Miss Reilly by Cecilia
Beaux, Miss King characterized as “good
brush work, but not real portrait paint-
ing;” unsatisfactory because it does not
fulfill the real business of a portrait, to
re-create the person. The picture of Dr.
Horace Howard Furness, Jr., by Alophe
Borie, she mentioned as “the nicest thing
that Mr. Borie has ever done.”

Two men represented this year by es-
pecially interesting work are Sidney Dick-
inson and Lazar Raditz. The latter's
“Portrait of Mrs. R.” reveals, according
to Miss King, “an artist’s power and
promise at the happiest moment at which
it can be taken, while he is still on the
up-grade.”

Miss King will speak in Chapel Friday
morning on the pictures for which prizes
have been awarded."

Dramatic criticism is one of the hard-
est things there is to do well, hence
failure is sometimes pardonable. But
even so, it is hard to forgive the write-
up of Varsity Dramatics, because the
trouble there was not lack of ability but
lack of effort. The article was not un-
intelligent; it was slovenly—from be-
ginning to end. Of the three plays “A
Merry Death” received the most attention
and the most thoughtful criticism. But
even there, surely Miss Babcock’s inter-
esting rendering of an exceedingly diffi-
cult part deserves more than one meagre
and spiritless sentence in recognition.

That “The Maid of France” is a miser-
able play must be obvious to everyone.
But that is no reason for ignoring the
acting. Good or bad, it should have had
some comment. The write-up of “Rosa-
lind” was good enough, so far as it went,
but it was inadequate. In this play, as in
the other two, the critic failed to appre-
ciate anything but the most protruding
of the “high spots.”

No sensible person wants a honeyed
write-up of a play, but everyone has a
right to demand a thoughtful and thor-
ough criticism that is proportionate to the
effort and value of the production. It is
unfortunate that the News should have
chosen Varsity Dramatics as a time to
lapse from its usual standards.

WILL DESCRIBE WORK IN GENEVA
AT MEETING MONDAY EVENING

The work that a World Student Feder-
ation foyer is doing in Geneva, where
several thousand students were stranded
when the war broke out, will be described
by Miss Elizabeth M. Clarke ex-94, secre-
‘ary for Switzerland, Monday evening in
Taylor. The foyer is partly supported by
the Bryn Mawr C. A.

In her report, which appeared in the
“Outlook,” Miss Clarke said “The stu-
dents represented some thirty nations, in-
cluding all the belligerents. Hundreds of
these students found themselves cut off
from contact with their home people and
from all means of getting either news or
money. The appeal to American gener-
osity is first to give them food.” Miss
Clarke goes on to quote from a letter that
she had just received:

“One evening last month Maruschka
went out and did not return. The follow-
ing day a letter arrived, addressed to her
two sisters who were in the University
with her, saying: “I am going away in
order to leave my part of our allowance
to you two; finish your medical studies
as soon as possible, so as to go back to
Russia to help our peasant women, who
need you. My share in helping them is to
make your work and life possible for you.
I go away.” Three days later her body
was found in the lake which her sisters
see from their window. If only there had
been a friend—with means—at hand, so
that Maruschka could have learned to
serve by life instead of death.
They are suffering for the simple neces-
sities of life, these students.”

The Student Christian Federation is
helping the foreign students in Switzer-
land materially and spiritually.

DIALOGUES AND GAMES
AT SPANISH CLUB TEA

Spanish games, dialogues, and recita-
tions enlivened a Spanish Club party at
which Miss Schenck was the guest of
honor last Wednesday afternoon. The
programme, which was arranged by Miss
Dorado and presented by members of the
Minor class, was:

Two dialogues, in which B. Cecil ’21, C.
Hayman ‘19, F. Allison '19 and H. Bennett
'21 took part; a third, Una Mala Memoria,
starring R. Hamilton ’19 and M. Noble
’21; and two recitations, La Marcha Real,
and La Mufieca, by C. Robinson '20 and
Miss Dorado.

“Henry Adams,” continues Mrs. Wright,
“had a good start in life, for he came
from Massachusetts, the State where, ac-
cording to Mr. Scott Nearing, 98 out of
eevry 60,000 white citizens become emi-
nent. Moreover, he was descended from
two Presidents and his father was min-
ister to Great Britain. But the ‘iron in
the blood’ had become diluted after so
Many generations and he suffered from a
paralysis of will, for which he paid the
penalty all his life.”

“Infant school, Harvard, Paris, Rome,
and London, all failed to educate Henry
Adams. Paris, however, seemed to afford
him some satisfaction. He touched life
at all points and immediately rebounded
to Paris. For seven years he taught his-
tory at Harvard and arrived at some re-
markable axioms concerning the teaching
profession. He finally abandoned it,
however, having decided that he could
neither educate nor be educated.”"

I take the liberty to quote below a bit
from Samuel Crothers’ “Pardoner’s Wal-
let’”’ apropos of the letter in last week’s
News by Vinton Liddell.................
He says: “If I were a duly licensed
pardoner, I should have a number of
nicely engraved indulgences for what are
called sins of omission, Not that I should
attempt to extenuate the graver sort. I
should not have anything in my wallet
for the acrimonious critic who brings a
railing accusation against his neighbor
and omits to sign his name. Some omis-
sions are unpardonable.”

I do not advocate that all the allitera-

tures, now so much in vogue, should be
abandoned, but why not sign your name
too? Something of this sort may be ef-

A collection of the verses carved on the
tops of desks in the class rooms will be

meeting tomorrow evening at 7.30 in the
Denbigh sitting-room. In addition to
local compositions the “Bashful Ballads”

Stephen Leacock, Gelett Burgess, and the
kittens’ christening scene from “Joan

_ The high level of the acting in the play,

| especially that of M. Krantz as Boniface,

the landlord, was the most outstanding
feature, she said. Particularly fortunate
was the choice of such opposite types for
the two heroes and heroines. She criti-_
cized the costumes and make-up of the
men, holding that in an eighteenth cen-
tury setting it ought to have been possi-
ble to make girls into more =
beaux and dandies.

The length of the play, Dean Taft be-
lieved its greatest fault. She suggested
that if some of the first scenes had been
run together the structure would have
been improved. She considered the in-
terest throughout admirably sustained.

Miss Taft regretted that during the
past few years so few classical plays had
been produced at Bryn Mawr. She
thought it a pity that three such slight
plays. as those given in the Varsity per-
formance, although they were charmingly
done, should form the most serious dra-
matic effort of the year.

Harvard and Columbia will undoubtedly

few women present’ themselves, Yale
herself may backslide. Such things have
happened.

To the Editor of the College News:

You have mentioned in your columns a
revival of the interest in the students’
building. Have any definite plans fér rais-
ing the money matured, beyond the one of
the Seniors giving Liberty Bonds that you
mentioned? How much money is actually
needed before the building can be started,
or have the committee all the necessary

money in hand?

In reply to the letter signed “Inter-
ested,” in the last issue of the News, I
wish to report the progress that has been
made in regard to the Students’ Building.
A recent meeting of the Undergraduate
Association voted that money should be
raised and plans revised with a view to
starting the building in the course of the
year. A canvass for money and bonds is
at present in progress among the under-
graduates and the Alumnez have been
asked to co-operate in the drive and have
promised to do so as soon as the drive
for the Victory French Chair is over. A
committee of Alumn# has been ap-
pointed.

As a result of the visit to other Stu-
dent Buildings, Mr. De Forrest, the archi-
tect, is preparing plans in co-operation
with an experienced Boston architect of
theatres. As soon as preliminary plans
are completed they will be published in
a circular and sent to the Alumnz and
friends of the college.

At present there is $25,000 in the fund
invested by the trustees, which, however,
cannot be used until $50,000 is obtained.
Probably the canvass of the college will
amount to $10,000 and there are several
entertainments to be given in the near
future for the benefit of the fund. There
have been individual donations of a fire-
place for the main hallway, a velvet cur-
tain for the stage, and the decorations for
two of the larger rooms.

The committee hopes to publish the
circulars in time for the Alumnz Re-
unions and Commencement. In the mean-
time, the committee is receiving sugges-
tions for the building, as well as dona-
tions, with open arms.

Shaw ‘nameitat Ohahe: Part of Drive

On Saturday morning it was announced
that an Anna Howard Shaw Memorial
Chair of Politics will be founded with the
first hundred thousand dollars collected
in the million dollar campaign.

Mrs. George Gellhorn, of St. Louis,
Bryn Mawr 1900 and a director on the
board of the National American Suffrage
Association, was made chairman of a spe-
cial committee to collect funds for the
memorial. An advisory committee com-
posed of prominent suffragists who
worked with Dr. Shaw for the passage of
the Federal suffrage amendment, will be
named next Thursday after the reception
to Mrs. Emmeline Pankhurst at the col-
lege.

Prof. Susan Miniahees who proposed
the founding of the chair, said, “The Dr.
Anna Howard Shaw Chair of Politics will
have a great mission. We are at the com-
mencement of a tremendous new era of
political development. Women statesmen
are needed as well as women voters.
Bryn Mawr will train the highest type of
American women for public leadership
and political activity.”

Intercollegiate Cooperation Part of Drive

Acting-president Taft presided over the
afternoon session, where the methods of
other colleges in rdising funds were dis-
cussed by Mrs. Barrett Andrews of Smith,
Miss Elizabeth F. Johnson of Vassar, and
Mr. Herbert Clark, chairman of the Phil-
adelphia Harvard campaign. Bryn Mawr
learned that the most modern business
methods must be employed, and every
channel possible used, to appeal, both to
the loyalty and interest of alumne, and
to the public, both rich and poor, for
whom high standards of American educa-
tion have both an idealistic and practical
value.

The Bryn Mawr News will print later,
for the benefit of students and alumne,
accounts of the Vassar, Smith, Princeton
and Harvard campaigns. Mrs. Francis,
of’ the Alumne Association, says that
Bryn Mawr people must profit by news
and experience from everywhere if they
are to succeed in the task before them on
behalf of “the best and fairest college of
them all.”

The conference closed, after tours of
the buildings, an occasional excursion for
“the room where she slept in 1900,” the
“tree that was planted in '91” and many,
many talks about the future and past of
Bryn Mawr, with a dinner at the college
inn, and a demonstration of Eurythmics
of Jaques Dalcroze, Saturday evening,
under the direction of P. de Montoliu.

The Bryn Mawr Campaign has begun.
What will your share be?

Social Work Described at Rally
“Swing Low, Sweet Chariot,” and oth-
er old melodies sung by the Cheyney
singers, speeches about Social Service
by Miss Applebee, Dr. Kingsbury, Dean
Smith and Miss Barrett, and dancing to
the college orchestra, were the features
of the Social Service rally held in the
gymnasium Saturday evening.
“The C. A. will take everything you
wear for junk,” said Miss Appleby,
when she explained the work of the Junk
Committee. Junk, she told, is sent most-
ly to the southern colored schools where
little boys go to classes in Bryn Mawr
bathing suits.

Social service work, began Dr. Kings-
bury, is entered upon from different
points of view. First is the volunteer,
no longer the Good Samaritan, but the
Good Citizen, who, when people talk
about making the world safe for democ-
racy, helps MAKE democracy. There
is also the professional, who helps pre-
pare herself in the social service field.
“But social service,” she concluded, “is
not just preparation. It is what you do
to help make the community better.”
Three years ago, according to Dean
Smith, Community Center started in one
big room, “with the community so big
you couldn’t see the center.” From this
classes evolved, in everything from the
debating society, which treated of sub-
jects like: “Resolved—That it is the
fault of men that women are so little
respected,” to gymnasium classes for
small boys who broke chairs and noses.

Miss Barrett, director of the Commun-
ity Center, told of chances for work at
the Center and at Preston, where “traf-
fic is still congested.” Social Service for
Bryn Mawr students, according to Miss
Barrett, is “getting what the town has
to give, and sharing what the campus
gives.”

1919 FORMS SOVIET HOCKEY TEAM

1919’s hockey team is an experiment in
Soviet Government, suggested by the Major
Politics course. The team moves as a
“body politic’ without captain, manager,
or coach, and whenever a question arises as
to which way to pass the ball, the game
is stopped and a vote taken. Nine mem-
bers of the class of “nineteen and a half”
are eligible.

May I make an inquiry through the

to ask whether the officials of the Self
Government Association intend to con-
trol quiet hours. Pembroke East can
in no sense be said to “keep” quiet hours.
A letter has already been written to The
News by a Pembroke East student in
regard to this, but no action has been
taken. The evening quiet hour is dis-
turbed again and again every night, and
after the 10 o’clock or 10.30 o'clock quiet
hour has begun the second-floor corri-
dor is never quiet: in fact, as often as
four nights out of seven, the hall is
noisy until 12 o'clock or one o'clock. I
am not exaggerating when I say that
the proctoring is infrequent and for all
practical purposes perfectly ineffectual.
Why do we claim that we have Self
Government at Bryn Mawr when many
students in one hall alone are almost
completely indifferent to one of its most
essential regulations? What are the of-
ficials of the association for if not to
see that the students understand and live
up to Self Government?

In behalf of the present board, I wish
to state that no “Lantern” will be pub-
lished this year, and to explain why
such a step is necessary.

“The Lantern” which started in 1891,
and of which Miss Donnelly was editor-
in-chief during her senior year, was
originally the only gollege magazine.
Later The Philistine and then Tipyn
o’ Bob were: published, but The Lantern
continued to be the most important Bryn
Mawr magazine. In 1914, Winifred Good-
all who was editor-in-chief of Tipyn
o’Bob, was also editor of The Lantern
and from that time the two magazines
have been brought out by the same
board.

Recently, The Lantern came to be
regarded as an alumnae magazine—a
very different state from that which had
prevailed a few years earlier—and the
editors found, owing possibly to war
conditions, that the alumnae’s contribu-
tions were so few in number that it was
difficult to get out a Lantern at all. In-
deed I know that last year in answer to
about twenty letters that I wrote, I re-
ceived work from only one contributor.
The year before I had had an experience
practically similar. Interest among the
undergraduates was so slight that many
of them had no idea what The Lantern
was.

While The Lantern was thus passing
into a decline, printer’s rates were rising.
For awhile The Lantern’s deficit was
made up fom the Tipyn o’Bob funds, but
when prices rose fifty per cent in one
summer, it became impossible to sup-
port a magazine that had been brought
out at a loss when rates were lower.

In view of these facts, the editors
hope that those who care particularly for
The Lantern will realize that it is impos-
sible for it to appear this year, and, that
the college may not be wholly deprived
of alumnae work, the editors have made
the present issue of the Bryn Mawr Re-
view an alumnae number.

There are certainly many students and
alumnae who will not sympathize entirely
with the point of view set forth in last
week’s issue of the College News, in re-
gard to “extinguishing” the Lantern.
Whatever the Lantern is at present—and
there seem to be grave doubts prevailing
as to who is responsible for the “dim
light,” it was one of those traditional
possessions of which Bryn Mawr was
proud in the past; the waning and pass-
ing of such traditions must always meet
with some regret.

Undoubtedly, the Lantern’s quondam
brilliance has paled; perhaps the time
has come for it to be relegated to the
shelf. There are several points, however,
in the statment of the Editors
with which one may take issue, The
Lantern is not and never was an Alumnae
publication as a glance over past num-
bers will show. In former years gradu-
ates have contributed to it and even
edited it, but for the most part the con-
tributors were alumnae connected with
former boards or very recently out of
college and interested with their friends
in college in seeing the magazine suc-
ceed. Of late years the under graduates
seem not to have felt the interest and
responsibility that such a representative
publication should arouse and the alum-
nae have been more and more solicited
for contributions. I do not believe how-
ever that the alumnae would wish to
claim the Lantern as their publication,
any more than they would wish to be-
lieve that the last number of the Bryn
Mawr Review was a_ representative
Alumnae number.

It is true that the Lantern has been
appearing later and later in the summer—
due to the fact that the editors have
been dilatory in their work, but not
many years ago the Lantern appeared
regularly in the spring and was reviewed
in chapel by the President of the col-
lege.

Since there are a large number of
students at present in college who are
very much interested in writing, it would
seem unfortunate to allow the Lantern to
be eclipsed. It needs only a revival of
undergraduate interest to maintain a
very good tradition which has been al-
lowed to decline through passivity on
the part af the under graduates. It is
their publication and they should make
it worthy of the College.

DR. G. A. JOHNSTON ROSS INTERPRETS
CONCEPTION OF GOD

Dr. G. A. Johnston Ross, of the Union
Theological Seminary, New York, speak-
ing in Chapel last Sunday evening, set
forth some essentials for the comprehen-
sion of God’s character.

Is it the present day tendency to stress
the severity of God sufficiently? was Dr.
Ross’ first consideration. Contrasting
the “molluscous” God of the churches
and the terrible God of nature, he prov-
ed that there was nothing inconsistent
in the union of love and severity.

“The Pagan is the antithesis of the uni-
versal,” a quotation from Benjamin
Kidd’s “Science of Power,” was the slo-
gan that Dr. Ross would apply to all who
followed a conventionalized and “Sun-
dayized” God. “Religion is not too
beautiful for business,” he explained.

A God who would be a co-sufferer and
one whose “suspiration would outweigh
his inspiration,” according to Dr. Ross,
would supply the human longing for the
mystical and yet would not set forth a
doctrine exegetically wrong.

We understand there is some talk of
making chapel compulsory for the re-
mainder of the year. Such a measure
would be peculiarly unfortunate, as_ it
would change chapel from a small body
of those who go of their own accord
to a large body of unwilling grumblers.
It would be treating an ethical question

The entire college may well feel proud
of the comment on the College News
made by Mr. Robert MacAlarney of the
Pulitzer School of Journalism, Columbia
Universiity, after his visit to Bryn Mawr
early this: month. Mr. MacAlarney writes:
“What I like about the College News,
and what I liked in my brief glimpse of

bf. horse earnestness which seems
to be tadiated. There seems to be a gen-

any too plentiful in college journals. As

a matter of fact I believe that the Col- | Commissioner, New York City, and Lec-
lege News compares very favorably with | turer on Public Health, Teachers’ Col-

any man’s college weekly.”

Mr. MacAlarney was particularly pleas-
ed with the account of his own lecture
at Bryn Mawr.

“The reporter who covered this story,”
he writes, “it seems to me, packed into
what she wrote all that was necessary—
that is the theme of the talk, which was
truly presented as being an exposition
of the grimness of the writing game. I
do not believe that there is any fault to
find with this little story. It was a good
piece of properly compressed work. As
a matter of fact there was not a flaw to
lay hand upon.”

The physical makeup of the News
brought forth considerable adverse criti-
cism. The members of the board agree
with Mr. MacAlarney that typograph-
ical defects exist, and, I believe, they in-
tend to take action immediately on his
suggestions.

What is particularly pleasing to friends
of the News is Mr. MacAlarney’s com-
ment on the editorial page.

“The editorial page | like. It is not
amateurish and the writers as a rule really
have something to say.”

This is high praise from a specialist
and I congratulate the News upon de-
serving it.

In considering the presidential condi-
dates, one cannot omit Hiram \V. John-
son, of California. His public career be-
gan ten years ago, and since that time
he has twice been elected governor of
his state, then senator, and once he was
the candidate for the vice-presidency
under the Progressive ticket with Roose-
velt. +

During his term of office as governor
he brought about numerous reforms
most especially in the politics of the
time, whose crookedness was proverbial.
But after Johnson the corrupt had be-
come incorruptible, As a_ result, John-
son has the complete support of the
people, and owns all the political ma-
chinery of the state (which enabled him
to defeat Hughes for president).

He was one of the “bitter-enders” in
the Treaty fight in the Senate, and his
will be an anti-league candidacy against
‘Hoover, but this is an outcome of his
loyalty to the doctriiie of “America first,”
and his code of allegiance to no-one.

Finally, since he is a Republican, a
proved business executive, progressive, a
fighter, and since in all these, Roosevelt
is his nearest prototype, Johnson must
be classed among the chief candidates.

Practical Rally to Wood

To the Editor of College News:
Students, theorists, and women, no
matter how high their mental calibre,
lack practical experience in government-
al affairs Yet these three classes are
among Mr. Hoover's strongest backers.
This is no time for testing the ability
of untried men. The country needs a
man experienced in government to ex-
tricate it from its present entanglements.
Such a one is General Leonard Wood,
supported by business men, successful
as governer of Cuba, and backed by a
strong and faithful party in Congress.
Practical at any Price.

To the Editor of the College News:

No one could possibly regret more than
myself the impression that muS&t be creat-
ed upon outsiders and upon our distin-
guished visitors by the discourtesy of
students at their lectures. I am in a
position to feel this keenly, as I was
obliged myself to leave early with an
outside guest at the lecture lately given
by Mr. St. John Ervine. The thought
occurred to me then, and may _ have
to others, that a delay of forty
minutes in introducing a speaker may
be as great a discourtesy to him as the
departure of a few of the audience that
much early, and may indeed be the cause,
however unjustified, of subjecting him
to the second indignity. If it were
not beyond the courage of our managers
to commence a lecture before the reservy-
ed seats are filled, the burden of discourt-
esy might fall upon another group, not
all of them college students.

right,” is one of the common sayings in
Persia.
“The Persian character mingles a

strong love of beauty with a deep re-
spect for etiquette,” said Mr. Weston.
“Every Persian is at heart a poet. Phrases
such as ‘Your presence has made all
Persia a garden’ are expressions of
everyday courtesy”

“What Persia needs to make her one
of the progressive nations,” Mr. Weston
concluded, “is strong policing, a system
of finance and transportation and foreign
help in education.”

Magdalen College, Oxford. Benjamin
Rogers wrote the music in 1685. Miss

‘Mary O’Sullivan, Head Cataloguer, has

translated the hymn into English at the
request of the News,

“O God, Our Father, we worship Thee
and give praise to Thee, who dost renew
our bodies with food and our souls with
heavenly grace.

We adore Thee, O Jesus, the only-
begotten Son, who didst not disdain to
enter the prison of a maiden:

Lifted high on the cross, Thou wast
offered our sacrifice to God’s justice:
through Thee, our one Savior, the hope
of life has come back to us.

Ever do we bless Thee, O Eternal
Spirit, through whose might Mary bore
the God of little Children.

O Triune God, O. Best Author of man’s
salvation, with prayerful lips we praise this
unfathomable mystery.”

An account written in 1847, of the
singing of the hymn at Oxford describes
it as follows....“The choristers assem-
ble there (on the tower) in their white
gowns, at a little before five o’clock in
the morning, and as soon as the clock
has struck, commence singing their ma-

the college are covered with spectators;
indeed, it is quite a little fair,”

May I suggest that nothing could give
greater pleasure to the community at large
than to have the Masques repeated on
Garden Party night. Their success on
May-Day merits another performance. If
the Russian Choir cannot be obtained, in-
stead of spending large sums of money on
untried talent, it would be better to use
college material and from Garden Party
night to gain clear profit for the Endow-

All of us who have been to cullege,
know that the experience of living to-
gether is a great part of our educa-
tion. There are very many boys and girls
in Bryn Mawr who will never have this
opportunity of going to college.

One of the main purposes of the Cen-
ter is to supply opportunities to the boys
and girls, men and women of Bryn Mawr.
The summer camp which we are now
planning will perhaps give to those of us
in Bryn Mawr who have not been and
who will not go to college, some of the
fun and some of the training which col-
lege gives.

One week at camp under the sky is
worth a whole year of club meetings
under a roof when it comes to real friend-
ship and the discovery of what stuff peo-
ple are made. If any of you want the best
opportunity which you can have of
knowing your Bryn Mawr neighbors and
have any time to spare between the mid-
dle of July and the end of August, I
recommend your investing a week of it
at the Community Center Camp.

SOLUTION OF WORLD IN IDEALISM
ASSERTS DR. SOARES

Basing his talk on the Sermon on the
Mount, Dr. Theodore Soares, Professor
of Practical Theology at the University
of Chicago, spoke in Chapel Sunday
night,

“The theories which Jesus expounds in
the sermon are his secrets of life, inter-
preted in terms the people could under-
stand. To us they seem too ideal to be
possible, yet ultimately that principle in
them is the one thing that really works.
It will be a long time before we learn to
apply these teachings of Jesus, but until
we do, until we discard power and force
as our medium, we can never make the
world right.”

We appreciate that letters about the
freshness of Freshmen are perennial oc-
currances, It is highly possible, though
not altogether probable, that formerly
there have been entering classes as fresh
as 1924; we only hope that there will
never be again. We do not believe that
Freshmen should be forced to get the
proverbial “worm’s-eye view” of college,
but on the other hand there is no rea-
son why she should see it from above
the Seniors’ heads—a point of vantage |
which 1924 has apparently assumed.

We have been told by Freshmen that
the reading of Freshmen Rules was
“amusing,’ though rather unnecessary,
because, as they pointed out to us un-
enlightened, all the rules are printed in
the C. A. handbook, and they have had
ample opportunity to study them before
even coming to college. By this study
they seem to have profited very little.
Every community has a set of laws made
by the majority, that must be observed
by its members, irrespective of whether
certain individuals regard them as. un-
reasonable or foolish: In Bryn Mawr’s
particular case the rules have been made
by people who have becu rreshmen
themselves and have learned the value
of observing them. We doubt that
away from Bryn Mawr a many of the
Freshman would close a door in any one
else’s face, would fail to rise when an
older person entered the room or address
comparative strangers with flippant fam-
iliarity.

The conspicuous and offensive fresh-
ness of individuals in a hall will put a
stigma upon their entire class in that
hall. Unfortunately, however, the fresh
individuals are in the large majority. The
efforts of the well-behaved few are prac-
tically swamped, and the college is sim-
ply given a disagreeable impression of
composite bad manners.

We realize how important each mem-
ber of '24 thinks herself, because she has
gotten here, respect for her great
achievement should undoubtedly be
shown her. But has she stopped to con-
sider that the Upper Classes have not
only done as much as she, but they have
stayed (will she be able to do that?) Is
not some deference due to a person who
has been tried and proved worth some-
thing to the college?

Finally while the college welcomes the
Freshmen, it feels a subconscious ques-
tioning, amounting almost to resentment,
for the Freshmen are taking the place
and the color of the former Seniors,
whom it has loved and who have led it.
If care is not taken this feeling can be
stirred to a strong antagonism by the
tactless self-assurance of the entering
class that has proved itself nothing as
yet—Eight Sophomores."

The other day in Pembroke Dining
Room a visitor was surprised to hear a
table of graduates and undergraduates
conversing in French over their peas
and pdtatoes with frank enjoyment. Her
surprise increased when she learned that
French was spoken at that table at every
meal. The aid of several of the French
graduate students and members of the
French Club more than sufficed to “keep
the ball rolling.”

Is the plan not a feasible one for the
other halls to adopt? In every college

dining room there must be a handful of
students who talk French with compara-
tive ease. The obvious advantage of such
practice—even apart from the fun of it
would seem to make it worth while.—

” Whether it is isecaiiil ‘él soil, jalan
situation, or what is more probable, close
contact with an ancient culture, Bryn Mawr
graduates flourish in China. I use the word
“flourish” advisedly. In spite of the variety
and diversity of their occupations, ages and
tastes, they have a quality in common. They
all seem gayer, younger and more in love
with life than the average of their class-
mates at home, and than would seem com-
patible with the dignity and responsibility
of their pursuits. In short, they flourish
and cause all about them to flourish.

At Peking, we found Alice Boring, ’04
(whose Chinese name is “Bas”), teaching
Physiology and conducting research work
at the Peking Union Medical College. She
held a two-year appointment, a sort of
Oriental holiday between a brilliant term
of service at the University of Maine and
a new appointment at Wellesley. Serious
persons of scientific mien took us aside to
confide in us the loss science in the Far
East would sustain if she persisted in her
decision to return to America. Frivolous
persons plucked at our elbow and bewailed
the fate of Peking dinner parties without
the pungent spicy savour of her wit.
Wuchang is a small walled town in the
heart of China, situated on the Yangtse
River opposite the great industrial city of
Hankow. No foreign business firms are
permitted within its walls, but there are
many missions, several schools, Boone Uni-
versity for men and the largest hospital
for women in China, Dr. Mary James, ’04,
reigns over this as a supreme monarch.
She is as slim, as keen and a trifle younger
looking than I remember her as a Fresh-
man. Against the background of a great
hospital with its surgical ward, maternity
ward, tuberculosis ward, its nurses’ train-
ing school, its dispensary and department
of public sanitation, all the cumulative
product of a cool head and a warm heart,
“little Mary James” stands out easily as
one of the biggest figures in China.

Just outside the city walls is St. Hilda’s
School for Girls. It is under the American
Church Mission and is about the size of
Bryn Mawr College. Deaconess Kate
Scott, ’04, is the principal. She is even
handsomer than she was as an undergrad-
uate. Everybody within gunshot comes to
talk things over with her, not. only because
she helps them out of any difficulty they
may happen to be in, but because they like
to. She presides over a delightful house-
hold of American teachers; she conducts
Episcopal services in Chinese; she teaches
English Literature to the Chinese as it
should be taught to the Americans: she
teaches mathematics in Chinese so lucidly
that I could understand the mathematics
(it was addition and subtraction). She
keeps in touch with every girl who leaves
the school and is a permanent influence in
the lives of hundreds of Chinese women.
She has warm friends among Chinese men;
she reads the Chinese classics; she is a
living part of both the Old China and the
New.

Katharine Van Wagenen, '04, and her
husband do much the same work as Kate
Scott, at I-Chang, which is a long trip up
the Yangtse from Hankow. Unfortunately
we did not see them, but we heard reports
of their good work in many parts of China.

Jane Ward, '05, is General Secretary of
the Y. W. C. A. in Shanghai. Everybody
who goes to China ought to talk with her
(and everybody who does not go to China
ought to talk with her!) Her interests
are less specialized than the others. She
meets people from other lands and is in
touch with many projects. She seems to
have developed a sixth sense, an under-
standing of the hopes, aspirations and in-
tentions of the young generation in all
countries. She knows more about the sig-
nificance of the religious and ethical move-
ments in which young people are interested



‘inal enthusiasm and initiative.

-in anything else. I suppose this is because

lather tenet Soe ek She has at-
tained something which I think must be
rare among Y. W. C. A. secretaries, a com-
plete tolerance and intelligence on religious
subjects without an atom less of her orig-

(Bryn Mawrtyrs in China are interested
in and talk about books, ideas, politics, re-
ligion, philosophy, science and human
nature. They do not seem to be interested

they are not distracted, as we are, by mod-
ern conveniences, and they don’t bother
about exercise. )

Margaret Hendy Bates, ’05, also lives in
Shanghai. Her husband is professor at
St. John’s University. They were leaving
for a holiday the day after we arrived, and
my only contact with her was a spirited
conversation over the telephone.

after we had landed, we ran into Elizabeth
Faries, 12. A few days later we visited
her at Truelight Seminary, a great college
preparatory school for girls in the sub-
urbs of Canton. It would be hard to say
just what her position is. She is vice-
principal, secretary, teacher of English,

On the Bund at Canton, ten minutes |,



leader in athletics. She is the innovator of
all good things and the quintessence of |
Truelight. Her hair is just as yellow (and!
the Chinese adore her in spite of it); her
lashes are even longer. She is wiser, gayer
and younger than during her Senior year
at college, but is otherwise the same old
Faries. I found myself being extraordinary
thankful that no wrong-headed preparatory
school teacher had side-tracked her to an-
other college. I could not have borne to
have her at Smith or Vassar!

To many of us, Canton Christian College
is the place where Fanny Sinclair, ’01, went
after she married Andrew Woods. Un-
luckily the Woods were in America when
we were in Canton, They have now
to Peking, where Dr. Woods is
with the China Medical Board But their
memory still lingers at the-C. C. C. We
saw their house, their~garden and Tom
Woods’ foot prints in the cement walk in
front of the Administration Building.

Lillie Leeche, ’99, is head. of the English
Department and the only woman on the
faculty. But she is much more than that.
She is the uncrowned Dean of every am-
bitious student, boy or girl, who needs ad-
vice, help or encouragement. Canton Chris-
tian College, more than any other institu-
tion, is training the leaders of young China.
We shall never know how many of China’s
great men of the future will owe their
start in life, either for financial help, teach-
ing of English, wise council or the friend-
ship that is more valuable than all, to Lillie
Leeche. Many people told us about her
influence in all things of the mind and
spirit. They all agreed that they knew but
a fraction of the whole. Like all good
teachers, she is a passionate gardener and
grows chrysanthemums with her collegians,"

DR. HENRY S. COFFIN CONDUCTS

SUNDAY CHAPEL SERVICE



Will Lead Mid-week Conference

Answering the question “What is there
in religion anyhow?” Dr. Henry Sloane
Coffin, of the Madison Avenue Presby-
terian Church, New York, spoke in
Chapel Sunday evening. Dr. Coffin, one
of the most popular speakers at Bryn
Mawr, according to Christian Associa-

tion records, has been secured to lead the -

Mid-week Conference in February which
this year takes the place of the usual

Week-end Conference. *
Refreshment, cleansing, light and
power, burden-bearing and fertility,

beauty, unifying and marking off bound-
aries, are the functions of religion, as
they are of a great river, Dr. Coffin de-
clared. “Is it possible that men coming
with divers needs and desperate long-
ings would declare that they find in reli-
gion what they seek if there really is
nothing there? They cannot all be de-
ceived,” said Dr. Coffin.

Finding faith is very like learning to
float, Dr. Coffin pointed out. It is neces-
sary to “let oneself go” entirely before
one can realize that “underneath are the
everlasting arms.” “We can make the
venture,” said Dr. Coffin, “because Christ
has gone before.”

A compromise has been offered to ap-
pease those who do not wish to give
up class plays, and at the same time
want Varsity Dramatics. A semester,
filled with Varsity Dramatics, Senior
Play and Glee Club, together with Fresh-
man Show and Junior-Senior Supper
Play, as skits, would seem overcrowded.
Moreover, at present there is not a
superfluity of dramatic talent in college,
and the best of each class must needs
go into Varsity Dramatics. Class plays
will be seriously handicapped by this
loss, and skits, often overworked and
forced, would be utter failures without
some dependable acting.

Class plays in the past have been
known to be fully as successful as Var-
sity Dramatics. Why not concentrate
the efforts of the college on really good
class plays instead of dissipating them
on a series of skits, Glee Club and Var-
sity Dramatics, each of which would
detract from the other and from the
main production? After a year of May
Day we would do well to have a normal
year with good class plays,



Opposed.



To the Editor of The College News:

The next big constructive enterprise
before the college is the erection of a
Students’ Building, and of all the aspects
of this contribution to the life of the col-
lege, that of the theatre will be most im-
portant. Varsity dramatics seems to be the
vehicle by which the undergraduates can
most effectively co-operate in carrying out
the undertaking, from both a financial and
a dramatic standpoint.

Varsity dramatics clears at least $500
every time it is given; class plays mean
an expense of at least $300 to the class.
The publicity of a Varsity play offers a
medium for reaching subscribers to the
building. With the record of a successful
May Day immediately behind us, we cannot
offer the outside public a play in which
the effect of two or three good principal
characters is lessened by the support of a
mediocre cast. In Varsity dramatics a
small cast of the best actresses in college
would give a really finished performance.
These are the means by which Varsity
dramatics could be of immediate assistance
to the Students’ Building.

A forward-looking policy toward the
time when we shall give plays in the build-
ing demands that we start at once to obtain
the necessary experience. The time allotted
to the production of class plays at present
is insufficient to give more than amateur
finish to the performance. The time which
would be allowed for Varsity rehearsals
would be adequate for a play whose dic-
tion, stage business and minor characters
could be developed to the excellence of a
May Day production.

A Word to the Wise
To the Editor of The College News:

Why, yes! “Look to your English.”

Never could so sensible an ending be
expected from that would-be Diatribe
against French tables, inserted in last
week’s issue of the News.

If this “langue des dieu” was too much
for that “uneducated native” to bear, who
most unfortunately strayed into our com-
pany, we, in turn, cry mercy at the new
style of “obscurantism” developed in her
letter.

Bi-linguists as we are, we yet cling to
the world-old principle, much in favor with
institutions of learning that

“Ce que l’on congoit bien s’enonce claire-
ment.

“Et les mots pour le dire arrivent aisé-
ment.”

On the strength of that argument we
cannot but agree to her conclusion, and
earnestly advise her to avoid cosmopolitan
quarters before having mastered a clear
and intelligible use of her own tongue.—

With the Red Moth team scoring 1 to 0
against the Griffin’s green players, the first
sixth team match game in the history of
Bryn Mawr was staged last Wednesday
before a wildly enthusiastic grandstand.

The goal on which hung the fate of the
Senior sixth was scored by K. Cowen, cen-
ter forward, during the first half of the
game. As the ball crashed between the
goal posts, cheers of wild enthusiasm broke
from '21’s section, where L. Reinhardt, col-
lege song leader; E. Cope, president of the
Athletic Association, and E. Donnelly, with
the team mascot, were among the ardent
rooters for the red-skirted sixth.

Sophomore fans, no less enthusiastic,
spurred their team on with cheer and song,
but an impermeable defense, Goddard and
Gates starring, proved the green’s trump
card, and the score was held 1-0 for the
Seniors.

Honor System, applying to all branches
of college activity, class-room honor,

Need for Teachers Still Great

Shortage of teachers throughout the
United States is still a serious problem,
according to reports received from a
large number of county and district su-
perintendents. As the result of an in-

Education Association it was found that
average conditions are slightly better
than last year where salaries were raised,
but there are a great number of schools
which have no teachers or only incom-
petent ones. A great need is felt for ap-
plicants to fill these positions, who have
had two or more years of training after
high school.

Twelve of the thirteen campus Italians
come from the Abruzzi and Rome, and
only one from Naples. A more equal di-
vision of northerners and southerners,
according to Mr. Chandler, the superin-

result in “rows,” since the sectional
rivalry, which Italy asserts to have out-
grown, persists among the day laborers
in America. Fortunately for the peace
of campus, Naples is in the minority.

Out of the thirteen, ten are married
and have from two to twelve children.
Except Palmerio Delfrizzi, lately ar-

Madam: An English friend living in
Switzerland has found two very gifted
mathematicians in a state of destitution
in Vienna. One is a boy of twenty-two,
named Kerékjart6é, who was practically
starving; the other a Professor Dienes,
who has a wife and two little boys, aged

four and six. The children were put in

a home for abandoned children sup-
ported by an English mission, but the
home was so overcrowded and the food
so inadequate that they were pining
away; Madame Dienes was giving danc-
ing lessons to try to support them. Pro-
fessor Hadamard told my friend about
them, and she has decided to ask them
all to come to live in her house in Vaud.

She has appealed to me to ask for
help in America to buy the food neces-
sary for the five visitors until they can
be got into England, where modest po-
sitions have been found for them. There
are, however, still difficulties in getting
admission to England to take up work.

Two dollars a day is necessary for the
food. It has occurred to me that stu-
dents who have been planning to give
to the Hoover Fund for Starving Chil-
dren, or knowing friends who are sub-
scribing to the fund, might be willing

to give me a portion of their subscrip-

tion, knowing that it will go to scholars
who are suffering from no fault of their
own. These unfortunate people are
Hungarians and took no interest in the
war.

Mrs. Slade Recognized Especially

Resolutions expressing the gratitude
of the directors of the college have been
sent to Mrs. Caroline McCormick Slade
and members of the joint committee of
the Bryn Mawr Endowment Fund.

Special recognition is given to Mrs.
Slade, of whom the resolutions say:
“Above all and beyond all the unex-
ampled success of the campaign is due
to the wide vision of the Chairman of
the National Committee, Caroline Mc-
Cormick Slade, to her genius for or-
ganization and to the rare power that
she possessed to put into moving and
eloquent words the love and gratitude
felt to the college by her daughters, and
to arouse in them, and also in outside
people, enthusiasm for Bryn Mawr's
ideals.”

Philadelphia. The stockings being filled
will be sent to the Kensington Light-

are being filled for seven old ladies at

Quoted from a quiz-book in Major Eng-
lish: “And the fair Cressitla acted accord-
ing to the old Romantic law of immorality.”



‘were proposed: st the eéeond meeting of

the Deanery. President Thomas presided.

Voicing a faculty opinion that the level
of the students’ work has deteriorated ; that
students who spend only four days of the
week at college have no leisure to do their

atmosphere of college, and that constant
week-ends are a drain on the health of
the students, President Thomas outlined
three remedies. The faculty may have
classes on Saturday instead of Wednesday,
and have scheduled quizzes on Mondays.
The students may regulate the number of
week-ends a student may be away from
college. Or, finally, the question may be
regulated by public opinion. The student
members of the Council were in favor of
the last proposal.

It was decided that before the next meet-
ing of the Council the class presidents
sheild take the matter up with their classes,
and that definite statistics should be com-
piled. These statistics would cover the first
semester last year and this fall up to
Christmas vacation, and would show which
classes leave college most, and whether a
great many people go away frequently or
a few go away every week-end.

cil decided that a recommendation to this
effect be sent to all college organizations,
and that each association should notify its
committees of this: rule.

The procedure for students who wish to
use the Gymnasium or other buildings for
meetings was outlined again. Students
should see Miss Maddison about the date,
and get permission from President Thomas,
if necessary. Miss Maddison fills out the
slip, giving the original to the student and
keeping the carbon copy, which is sent to
Miss Adair, the business manager, and then
to Miss Applebee, director of gymnastics.
The student keeps the original until she
is able to make final arrangements with
Miss Adair. This should be a week before
the entertainment, if possible, and not less
than twenty-four hours before.

Wardens and hall representatives will
discuss a system of having a fixed sum
collected from the students and distributed
by the wardens, to all maids at Christmas
and in June, according to a decision of the
Council. Extra fees could be given to
chambermaids for extra service.

“Campus Notes” reviewing recent im-
portant events at Bryn Mawr, a letter
column open to both alumnae and un-
dergraduates, and editorial comment on
alumnae and academic affairs both at
Bryn Mawr and in the country at large,
are departments planned for the Alum-
nae Bulletin by Margaret G. Blaine, ""13.
Miss Blaine, who is also Executive Sec-

For some years past it has been. getting
more and more difficult to get outdoor
exercise during the winter months, Instead
of being outdoors walking or skating, which
give the. benefit of fresh air as well as
exercise, every winter, from the first of
December to the middle of March, we are
forced to exercise ‘inside in’a. poorly ven-
tilated room.

_ The criticism is not that*we do not wish
to exercise or that we are not willing to
do a reasonable amount of indoor organ-
ized exercise. What we do object to is that
due to“the exercise requirements, we are
unable to do in addition the amount of
outdoor exercise which is necessary in or-
der to enable us to do the best academic
work. It is ridiculous“to suppose that_one
can do her academic work, get in her, exer-
cise as it is now required, and ‘Still get any
more-outdoor exercise than is afforded in
the short walk: from the yall to the gym-

In the Nation for June 1, 1921, I came
across the following article which I thought
might be of ‘interest to your readers:

“Let us not forget, in our excitement
over having a president with a style, that
we have a vice-president with a style, too.
And he uses it. Not content with crack-
ing the whip over the Senate, he extends
his lash to the broad public which a great
man addresses in a great magazine. Just
now the magazine is the Delineator, for
June,. and the theme is the wicked ‘Reds’
who are slinking into the girls’ colleges and
corrupting the virgin minds there assem-
bled. Why, there is a thing called the In-
tercollegiate Socialist Society, he warns the
world, which has chapters in the colleges
and tells the girls about radical literature
and bolshevism and Russia and such, Barn-
ard ,is a hotbed, and so is Radcliffe;. at
Wellesley ‘the library has books for and
against socialism which show considerable
use’; Smith seems sane, for there discus-
sions of radical matters are ‘under direc-
tion and supervision,’ and -not many girls
read the dangerous books in the library;
Bryn Mawr has been kept safe for ortho-
doxy ‘by a rather complete representation
of books in opposition to socialism, which
have been much more read than like books
in opposition in- other colleges’;
Holyoke is almost immaculate. Let us not
be alarmed, he says, but merely armed
against this stealthy propaganda. “Adher-
ence to radical doctrines means the ulti-
mate breakdown of the old: sturdy virtues
of manhood and womanhood, the insidious’
destruction of character, the weakening of
the moral fiber of the individual, the de-

struction of ‘the foundations of civiliza-|
tion,’ (Pull for the. shore, sisters, pull for

the shore! The vice-president will help
you.) Interesting enough the: president of
the Senate does not mention the fact which?
practically all competent observers will
agree upon—that the women’s colleges,
taken as a whole, are the most active cen-
ters of intelligence and free apenas s in
the United States.”

“Pul for the shore, seers —- for the
shore” by all means, but first be sure that
you are not heading for the barren desert.

The week-end subject is not, as we
thought in June, one from which the ele-
ment of misunderstanding has been elimi-
nated. The letters received during the
summer by students who had taken more
than four week-ends a semester last year
were a great surprise after the agreement
arrived at in College Council last spring,
when the undergraduates were given to un-
derstand that no rule would be enforced
if the student body would undertake to
create an effective public opinion against
the taking of more than four week-ends a
semester. :

Whatever one may think about week-end
privileges—and I believe there were only
two. or three dissenting voices when the
agreement just stated was voted upon by
the Undergraduate Association—it cannot
seem fair to anyone to impose new condi-
tions for the tenure of their rooms upon
some students and not upon others. Only
these who took more than four week-ends
a semester last year, when no limit of any
sort was in force, were asked to “agree in
writing” to take no more than four this
year, or else forfeit their rooms. There
was no reason to suppose that, because
they were often away last year, they would
this year depart from the spirit of the
agreement they had made as members of
the Undergraduate Association.

And have we not the right to ask why
nothing was said in the Council meeting
about these letters; and why, if it had not
then heen decided to send them, it -was
thought necessary or right to do so after
the understanding reached between the un-
dergraduates and the College authorities ?

“(Continued from Page 1) «

land is ahead here with her forty-eight-

hour week.” The third, economic security,
“during the wogking life and -old age of:
the worker,” -this is the most important, for’
there will ‘never’ be industrial peace untile
we have solved the ;problém of unemploy-
ment; we have accepted it as an inevitable
evil, but jt is not sa Tithe fact of unem-
ployment is*not a ‘tragedy, ‘but the suffer-
ing and demoralizatiun. it causes. Work is,
of course, the great cure and there are’sev-
eral lines .of approach; (a) the govern-
ment may advance and retard demands of

work, the building ,of. public , memorials,
parks, roads, etc.;.(b) the worker may
have two jobs, as is usually the case in Bel-
gium,. where-.an enormous percentage of
men have bits of land in the country that
they work in ‘spare time and when busi-

ness is slack (Mr. Rowntreé has spent feur |

years studying the methods of Belgium) ;

(c) the government may provide eae
and rapid transit sq as to give better op-
portunity for two jobs and to enlarge the
labér market; (d) seasonable trades may

unemployment, as Mr. Rowntree showed,
but when all this is done there is still a
reserve of workers, for.a reserve of work-
ers is necessary to industry. This being so
it seems nothing less than logical that in-
dustry should take care of them. For a
doctor or barrister to be out of work ‘for
a tite is no tragedy, for he can merely
cut down his recreation, but for the laborer
to be a member of this réserve is hell! The
remedy is so easy, industry has simply ‘to
remove the menace and it can do so by
insurangg There. is no financial difficulty,
95 per cent. of men are on the average un-
employed, this leaves only 5 per cent. to
be supported, and statistics prove that if
we -would put aside only 3% per cent. of
our wage bill, we could remove the menace
forever. Neither England or America has
done this and since they know its efficacy

-|the only reason .can be great and over-

‘whelining ‘stupidity.”:.
The fourth, the status of the: s worker,
“since..a..worker is an essential to indus-

try, educated and a citizen, who should he |

be regarded as a slave.” Mr. Rowntree has

tried the three essentials of democracy,

legislative, executive and judicial power, in
his works and found it successful. He’ has
divided government. equally between em-
ployer and employee and has made no pro-
vision for a drawn decision which he hopes
impossible and which would at least be “a
change of troubles, .which, according to
Lloyd George, is as good as a holiday.”
“It is great fun,” said Mr. Rowntree, “to
lead men, more fun to lead than to drive,

‘for any old fellow can drive, but it takes «

an artist to lead.” co ‘

. These points of wages, hours, economic
security and social status, Mr. Rowntree
said; he had “not been arguing but telling.”
Of the fourth he did not feel so absolutely
sure since for its advocation he had been
denounced as a “socialist and a cousin of
Gompers.” It is the plan of giving work-
ers a share in the business after capital

| has reserved a sufficient return’ to attract

all capital necessary for the business.

Mr. Rowntree ) believes, “if we will pay
the price of these remedies,” ‘although i.
may sound revolutionary and Gompers-
cousinish, we will solve the problem. But
we must pay quickly, for the price is going
up, and pay in full if we expect the full
results. Pay with faith in the future and
faith in our fellow-men; pay in the spiclt.
of brotherhood. e

Tolstoi, Turgenev, Dostoievsky, one feels
that Andreyev has touched the lowest knot.
The othesyRussians have at least held to the’
hope that through some struggle, not de-
fined, by some way, still unmapped, toward
some goal, dimly seen, mankind may ulti-
mately be reclaimed. All this was expressed
by the unusually well-rendered - choral
prelude, “The Nightingale,” by Tschai-
kowski, which formed an appropriate in-
troduction to 'the younger Russian’s point
of view—death as the only~ deliverance.
Whatever may be our reaction to such
philosophy, we are compelled to admire
Andreyev’s last great outery of derisive
laughter.

SEES SEED OF FUTURE WAR IN °

“Make Abolition of Wars Guiding Star in
Politics,” Mrs. Catt Begs

“In all the world’s history nothing so
striking has-been done as: our nation’s offér
to scrap millions of dollars’ worth of un-
built ships,” Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt
declared in Taylor Hall last Thursday eve
ning. This lecture on “International Poli-
cies” was the fourth of a series of five
lectures on political’ subjects given under
the Anna Howard Shaw Foundation. —

“The seed of the next war lies in the
‘fact that one-sixth, of the population of
the world controls five-sixths.” ‘Tilustrat-
ing her points with maps, Mrs. Catt showed
how, through all the course of history, “the
ubiquitous Caucasian had everywhere staked
his claims for posterity’ until he now con-
trols an overwhelmingly large portion of
the world. “The-ext step in human evol
tion must result from the contest betwe
Caucasian and Asiatic races.” Control and
vision and the spirit of co-operation must
shape our international policies if we are to
avoid deadly enmity with these ‘colored
races, Mrs.'Catt declared. “If wars are to
end there must be behind. every measure
for peace the same press of public opinion
that backs the Washington Conference.
Popular opinion hag, made every delegate
there realize that his welcome home de-
pends on his backing radical measures to
limit arms. ;

“Let abolition of wars be our guiding
star .in politics,” said. Mrs, Catt. “From
the little election districts the movement
must come, The voté has the power to re-
make the world. J hope that women will
use their votes to end war.”

COMMUNITY CENTER RECEPTION

Mawr at a reception given last Tuesday
evening. Elizabeth Hobdy,* ’22, who
played the steel guitar; Helen Rice, yy

quartet furnished a musical. program.
Mr. Hamlin introduced Miss Hutton, and
after Miss Hutton’s reply, refreshments
were served and music for dancing was
provided.

College students this yeag will be as-
sistants in the clubs, working under a

sident of Bryn Mawr. This new ar-
eae was necessary, Miss Hutton
explained, because the College vacations
proved a serious interruption to the work‘
of clubs led entirely by College students.
In addition to strengthening the clubs
started last year the night schools for
foreigners will be reopened if possible.

“The children are clamoring for story
hours,” Miss Hutton said, and added that.
there would be need for student workers
in these. Both at’Preston and Bryn
Mawr the libraries are busy. The col-

""ALUMNAE: ‘NOTES
Henrietta N. Huff, 18, “4 sufgreney

Nedra t amas"
,,
cn1921-12-07.txt,['To the Editor of THE CoLLece NEWS:'],"

“Browsing” now weighs~ so heavily in
the scale of educational values that to en-
courage it clubs are formed, the question
of limited week-ends is agitated, the- word
is on the tip of every student’s tongue.
A professor from Stamford University
states’ the situation thus in terms which
might have applied directly to BrytiyMawr:

“The college student does not read be-
cause he has read so much; he thinks he
is too busy to read general literature;. stu-
dent ‘activities’ absorb all the time not
allotted to his- college*courses—or perhaps
I have the. order of importance reversed
for‘some cases; he has been warned for
so many years by so many Solomons not
to become. a bookworm that he really _re-.
gards this as a menace to his future. And
so we nieed to do what we can to overcome
these’ obstacles and calm these fears, The
end will justify some seemingly high-
handed means.” S

The “high-handed means” referred to
are a course which, this professor proposes
offering, in which two hours’ credit toward
a degree. would be given for six hours’
browsing, the students to be held. account-
able for what they have read, through in-
formal reports, essays or simple “signing
up.” The student will have from 1000 to
3000. volumes. of “literature, history and
the literary classics of science” from which
to choose. More advanced students might
be allowed the privilege of reading in the
stacks at large. .

Bryn Mawr must certainly see the value
of this. plan for enconraging general read-
ing. The problem involved is one of inter-
est to all faculty and students, who grant
that assigned reading for courses does: not
take the place of, general reading, who
agree with Mrs. Browning that,

“We ‘get no ea

‘And calculating profits—so much help
By so much reading. It is rather when
We gloriously forget ourselves, and plunge
Soul-forward, headlong, into the book’s

profound,

Impassioned for its beauty and the salt of
truth——.

’Tis then we get the right good | froma a
book.”

IN THE NEW BOOK ROOM

Probably the most interesting thing in
the New. Book Room this’ week is-a copy
of the American Intercollegiate Magazine
which contains three contributions from
Bryn Mawr; “Fire Weed” and “On the
Hilltop,” a sonnet, by Dorothy Wyckoff,
21, and “The ingdom That Knew It All”
(one-act play), by Vinton Liddell, ’22.

“Commemoration and Other Poems,” by

| Thomas Dwight Goodell, late professor of

Greek at Yale University, is the most re-
cent acquisition in poetry; ‘a very con-
servative group of poems published by the
author’s classmates after his death.
“Angels and Ministers, Three Plays of
Victorian Shade and Character,” by Lau-
rence Housman, is another very new book:
Mr. Housman writes in the preface, “just
at this moment the Victorian age-has, that
bloom upon it—autumnal, not springlike—
which in the nature of things cannot last.
That bloom’ I have tried to illumine before
time wipes it away.” The plays are called,
“The Queen, Bless Her!” “His Fa-
vorite Flower,” “The Comforter,” and
deal with domestic episodes in. the life of
Queen Victoria, a statesman and Mr.
“More Trivia” it is unnecessary to in-
troduce. All who know Logan Pearsall
Smith’s first little volume, “Trivia,” will
have a warm welcome for its successor.

My students, past and present, will be
interested to hear that in the recent report
of the teaching of English i in England sub-
mitted by the Departmental Committee
appointed by the Board of Education,
there are recommendations for courses in
speech-training similar to those that have
been given in Bryn Mawr. since 1902. It
is strongly emphasized that students

“should learn to recognize every sound in
standard English; should observe for
themselves how sounds are produced and
modified by the position of the speech or-
gans, and should practice producing: them
properly.” The report continues: “The
really scientific method, of course, would
be to associate each sound with a phonetic
symbol,” in--which the “real difficulty will |
be found, not in learning the symbols, but
in combating the causes which prevent pro-
duction of the correct sounds, such as

habitual lip laziness or inability to detect:

‘the less obvious differences.”

VASSAR LEADS GEOLOGY FIELD
TRIP IN ROCKIES THIS SUMMER

Extending an invitation to students from
other colleges the Geology Department of
Vassar College is conducting a geologic
field trip from June 21 to August 18 this
summer, in the Bitterroot Mountains of
Montana. It will count at Vassar as five
semester hours of academic credit and is
intended for students taking a general cul-
ture course as well as those specializing in
geology. One of the most interesting and
beautiful mountain regions of America
will furnish a laboratory for work consist-
ing largely of the interpretation of rock
sculpturing and landscape forms. The class
will study the many and varied problems
associated with the ancient glaciation of
the region, map the glacial deposits, and
secure the data for a report on the region.|
Five to six weeks will be required for this,
the remainder to be ‘spent’ in a study of
the great assemblage of glaciers on Mt.
Ranier, Washington.

The total expenses of the'trip are esti-
niated at $550 including railroad fare, camp
expenses, hotels, and tuition. The party
is limited to fifteen. Anyone at College
who is intérested should apply to the Bryn
Mawr Geology Department. -

The Principles of Aesthetics, by Dewitt
H. Parker, assistant professor of philoso-
phy in the University of Michigan, is “an
effort to obtain a clear, general idea of
beautiful objects, our judgments of’ them,
and the motives underlying the acts which
create them.” Professor Parker has chap-
ters on: a definition of art, an analysis of
aesthetic experience, discussions of the art
of music, poetry and prose and the relation
of art to nature.

Fyador Dostoyevsky, by Aimée Dosto-
yevsky, is an. intimate biography of the fa-
mous Russian writer by a very. devoted and
necessarily prejudiced daughter. It was
written to celebrate the centenary of his
birth, in October, 1921, and™at the same
time prove a source ofeincome for his
daughter. Besides being an interesting ac-
count of. Dostoyevsky himself; it gives a
rather unusual and striking picture of the
present situation.in Russia.

The Larger Soctalism, by ais Bene-
dict, is, as its title, implies, very broad-

movement,” it must’ recognize the impor-

The factor which has contributed most
to the strength and spirit of self govern-
ment is the personal responsibility felt by
every member of the Association. But is
it in accord: with the spirit of self-gov-
ernment that quiet hours should be a terror
both to the proctors and the proctored?
The lives of all proctors are made miser-
able by having to continually hush people

respect for self- “government, and continue
their noise.

Why would it not be better to abolish
sub-proctors entirely and let the power of
proctoring rest with every individual? The
office of head proctor, which*ts now noth-
ing but a dirty job, should be a more hon-
orable one.. As a member of the Advisoty
Board her duty would be to report to the
Board the names of those who have broken
rules; to report the general conduct of her
hall, and to proctor only in cases of ex-
treme necessity.. This system would leave
far more responsibility to each student and
help recreate the much talked of “spirit of
self government.” , The Association is
strong and has a strong tradition back of

At a meeting ofthe United States Field
Hockey Association, it was decided to ask
the English Association to recommend and
engage some coaches for the U. S. F. H. A
for this coming season. In answer to this
request some of the most noted English

| players. offered their services to the U. S

F. H. A, this next fall. In order that, the
broadest number of “American _ players
should ‘benefit by this coaching, I under-
took “to organize a -hockey camp during
September, for players and coaches, a spe-
cial request having come to me to do this

The editorial on the camp in last week’s
News has drawn three wrong conclusions
which I think out of consideration to the
English and American players who will be
at the camp. should be refuted.

The first, .a local -failing, in concluding
that Bryn Mawr players are specially-ton-
cerned, or at the camp will be specially
considered or concerned. Any and every
woman hockey player is invited to the
camp to take advantage of dhe coaching
and of playing With or se the best
American players.

Secondly, in inferring that an esimainal
system is being revived.” I know of no
other instance in the history of any sport
in which members of a victorious team
have volunteered to travel 3000 miles to
coach their quondam rivals in another

country from sheer love of their favorite

sport, nor of. any instance of sportswomen
coming together, regardless | of clubs, teams

interested in



‘

or factions, solely for the practice and im:
provement and enjoyment of: their. special
sport.

Lastly, like a certain type a person that
astonishes Europeans, and is the despair of
any progressive community at home by
concluding that the worst element in any-
thing is bound tobe the prevailing one
over here. When I first came to America
twenty years. < ago I was. forever being told
that American women would never play
hotkey because they had’ no ‘sense of good
sportsmanship, that professional athletics
were the only kind that would go in Amer-
ica. A-»dear old Boston lady begged me
not to go to a’ certain woman’s college be-
cause I should not be able to endure the
semi-professionalism of their sports.
my disgust I-heard the same type of thing
being said to members of the English team
last year by American non-players;—It-is-an
untrue, unjust wrong conclusion to
draw that becatise here, as- everywhere, the
crudest and most vulgar note is often the
loudest, and therefore the most heard, that
it is the prevails note, or the ifluencing
note. .

Every student shall, at the time of her
fall physical appointment, sign for the
competitive athletics she wishes to enter
during the year. During the fall and
spring these periods will be counted as
her physical training periods, during the
winter students signingr for gymnastic
meets can practice for the meet in the

counted as the two required class pe-
riods, Lists of students wishing to enter

E. RHODES EXPLAINS MEANING OF
C. A. PLEDGE
EV cata
Places Emphasis on Spiritua! Welfare
and Need for High Ideals

“The ‘Policies of the Christian Associ--

tion’ is, I think, a very forbidding title,”
said AZ. Rhodes, ’23, speaking in Vespers
last Sunday. “However, in spite of the
formality of the title what I hope to sav
is really very simple, though difficult te
express, for. | want to tell you’ of ou:
hopes for the Christian - A’ssociation . for
this year.”
—Miss--Rhodes explained that the Chris-
tian Association through its pledge means
to offer its membership to any student wh»
desires to live up to high ideals of life;
and that everyone, no .matter what her
theology, must realize the supremacy of
‘Jesus Christ as a moral and spiritual leader
She added that the word “worship” in the
second article means only that tribute of
admiration and appreciation that. we pay
to such supremacy.

Dividing the Christian Association in:o
divisions, the organization side, work at

.the Community Center, etc., and the evaa-

gelical afid spiritual side, Miss Rhodes said.
that first side. was well organized and that
what we need is to emphasize the spiritual
side more than we have done before. “We
go to chapel perhaps to be with our friends
or for half a dozen other ill-defined. rea-
sons, Or we stay away for. the same rea-
sons. We haven’t even cared enough to
think it out—we drift.

“For this year we do hope to emphasize
the spiritual side in a rather new way. We
do not want any religious ‘hysteria in the
College; what we do want is character.
We want intelligent enthusiasts, not saa
ferent folk.

“Our hope, for the Christian Association
this year,” concluded Miss Rhodes, “is that
we should become réal and positive char-
acters and live up to our ideals.” She added
that the influence of a group» who had the,

| courage to live out-their ideal of life would |
ix-|be beyond belief and that it would make |
the Christan Association a “real and liv-"

SPIRITUAL LEADERSHIP THE
RESPONSIBILITY OF AMERICA

ar
r.



.. 72

Dr. Chambertaine Explains Gift of
Christianity, to Foreign: Nations.

“Ameri®, _by reason of. its endowments
and equipment, thas come to occupy a lead-
ing place in ‘the world of politics, and is
coming to,occupy a commanding place in
the world of ideals,” said Rev: W..I. Cham-
berlaine ‘in =Chapel last Sunday evening.

“If we have assumed responsibility for
leadership, by what law are we exémpt
from leadership, in the -religious life?” he
asked. “It is a commonplace to dwell on
the fact that our horizon is gradually wid-
ening. Our forefathers were so concerned
in conquering the wilderness that’ they
were naturally gonfined to national in-
terests. Then we recognized an interna-
tional consciousness anda ~few~-years- ago
we came into a world consciousness.

“The measure of our ational success,
and I quote one of our late representatives
at St. James’, ‘is the amount that America
contributes to the thought, intellectual hap-
pine ‘moral energy . . . of mankind’
Japan, China, India, Arabia, these are the |
nations according to Dr. Chamberlaine to
whom we are responsible to”give some of
the spiritual concept of life. All the spir-
itual ‘truths that appear in the religions of
these countries appear in-our own religion
in a better and purer form. But in the
Christian religion each of these truths is
balanced by its corrective.

“The advent of Christianity,” concluded
Dr. Chamberlaine, “was the infusion of a
new and perfect personality, and when
such a _ Personality is introduced it can
never be expunged. a

THE SITUATION IN POLAND RE-
VIEWED BY MISS PARET

Poland and its present situation was re-
viéwed by Miss Paret, Y. W. C. A. worker
there since the armistice, at a tea given by
the World Citizenship Committee last Sun-
day afternoon and also later at Vespers.

The country, said Miss Paret, is made
up of Jews and Poles, and the two fac-
tions are bitterly and consistently opposed
to each other, in religion, politics and
every phase of existence. The Poles stand
for nationalism, the. Jews for anything
which will combat it, and at the approach
last winter of the Bolsheviki there was
great fear in Warsaw lest they side with
the invader and betray the city.

Miss Paret concluded witha few remarks
about Paderewski, who is . exceedingly
popular in Poland and. holds many high |
oftices. His wife, however, is not so for-
tunate, although she too has a place in the

politics of the country, a place won, said
\tiss Paret, by sheer strategy. To her hus-
band sitting late at momentous - cabinet
meetings, she is wont to come and in the
very face of* his* protesting’ ministers to
whisk ‘him home to a quiet fireside. This
may ,have its charms for “M. Paderewski,
but in the eyes of Poland it: is’ an intol-
erable indignity. r

Speaking of fie Polish pea aire at Ves-
pers, Miss Paret explained that their rea-.
son for going to College in spite of hard-
ships, was so that they could be of “service
to their country.” The Polish Univer-.
sities even demanded certificates showing
proof of service to their country during the

‘| period of threatened Bolshevik invasion.

-The Student..Relief. Fund-is administered
solely on the basis of the most needy. “The
task is a difficult one,” said Miss Paret,
“since there are none that do not need
help.” In Russia alone ninety thousand
students were helped, ten million meals
were served and twenty thousand text

confined to the elaborate Class plays, on

stress on the stage, as in one where there
are a great many students from which to
choose. Athletics, clubs, indeed all outside
activities, would inevitably ,suffer by the
introduction of a side issue.so alluring as
a Dramatic Club. If, however, such an in-
novation as Hall dramatics might be
brought about, an opportunity would im-

to work up-an interesting bit of acting, if
only in a small way. The work might be
original; or else chosen from some collec-
tion of one-act plays.. They .might be

duced @ithout the nerve-racking conscious-
ness that the honor of the class depends
upon it. If each Half made a custom of
presenting one or two plays during the

The state of dramatics in this college is
going from bad to worse; the range of.
choice of plays ‘and actors is so limited
in class plays that the standard is neces-:
sarily low. The same objection, in a
greater degree, would apply to Miss
Thomas’s suggestion in.the last News, fot

it was the great excitement of their lives,
and the least thing: gave them a. thrill.
They adored to have stories read to them
and by the end of-the summer most of
the older ones could really read for them-
selves. . They always stayed after school
while I tidied-up, fearful lest: they should
miss something.

But a six-hour teaching da} left lots of
time for other.things. It was then that we
played games, went for walks, and worked
in the gardens. Sometimes I read stories
to the older people who were pleased ‘with
anything from the Saturday Evening Post
to Grimm’s Fatry- Tales. Hardly. a day
passed that there wasn’t some one who
wanted-medical_advice,-a.toe fixed, .a.“gath-

scribed for.

The nicest thing about the + whole summer
was living with the people themsely es and
seeing how they got aléng with almost

ions as in May Day. ‘They would be
asked to go through the ceremony of the

The book shop has been brought before
our notice as an example of the co-opera-
tive system. In a_truly co-opérative society
the shareholders form a legislative body

.which employs the salaried manager and

votes concerning the handling of dividends.
Our “co-operative” society merely offers
us the chance to btiy shares at $2.00 and
dividends on 32% per cent. of the profits.
Another 32% per cent. of the profits goes
to scholarships, which is most praise-
worthy ; 39 per cent. to capital and surplus.
But all. this is not done with the vote of
the shareholders.

I object, therefore, to the store’s claim-

ing to be co-operative when fundamentally

it is not what its name implies. Here at
Bryn Mawr we study some theory of eco-
nomics. .Why should we delude ourselves
by fancying that we have the real example
of a coming economic order? In no way
do I wish to descry the management of

foreseen blocks all retreat. .

But customary_as_it-is-to lump the Amer-

“think” or are trying to. “They are seek-

being filled with a dry intellectualism, or
reacting to it in the form of a hot-air. radi-

Referring to the opinions on Freshman
Rules expressed in your last issue, may I
ask upon what grounds Miss Lomas bases
her statentent that the artificiality and the
censure of inter-class relationships are due
not to the Rules, but rather to human na-
ture? Since Bryn Mawr has had no experi-
ence of what human nature is like without
Freshman Rules, it might bgemore profit-
able to look at conditions in collegesgwhich
have. ;

At Vassar there are no such regulations
for Freshmen, and (I think consequently)
public opinion-does*not even take note of
roommates who are in different classes,
becduse the circumstance indicates, mothing
At Prince-
ton ,there is relatively no class distinction
after the first few’ months: of Freshman
year, If, as Miss Lomas believes, the main-
tenance of it is a deep-seated necessity of
human nature, Vassar and Princeton, to

in the slightest degree unusual.

say nothing of numerous others, seem to be

singularly unconscious of the need. 1

In fact the human nature argument is all

too readily employed by controversialists |

in defense of tradition, And it is danger-
ous, as it often recoils upon itself; for:if:
the principle of class distinction springs
from_ uncompromising prejudices in our
natures, why do we need to bolster at up
with a precise set of regulations, an officious
machinéry-of enforcement, and an exacting
public opinion? If the respect for it is
inherent in the individual, it ‘should not
worry Moss Lomas to see the Rules re-
I do not believe that this is true;
as I have elsewhere endeavored to point
out, but granting that it is true, and that
the “childish things we do and say” to stu-
dents in other classes are simply “due to
something in the individual which,only the
individual can. remedy,” I nevertheless sub-
mit that it is one thing to act childish (be-
cause individual natures happen to demand
it) and quite another to insist, in writing,
that all entering Freshmen do the same! ~

At the risk of seeming to lay too®much
stress upon the satirical aspects of the
question, may I suggest that merely to
change the title of the regulations as “writ-
ten in the Handbook is rather like disguis-
ing a fermented beverage in a perfume
bottle. Moreover, it is apt to compromise
the good tame of perfumery in general.
It will profit us little to confuse names,
for a ridiculous rule will be none the less
so for being called a tradition. Lantern
Night is a tradition; so is the singing of
the Magdalen Hymn on the tower of
Rockefeller. . Shall we place beside these a
somewhat more delicately groomed version
of the following : “Tt is-a tradition of Bryn
Mawr that the sidewalks be kept clear of
Freshmen and similar encumbrances out of
deference to the Seniors, since they (like
the German officers before- the War) are
accustomed. to this and other evidences of
respect a on the: part of their inferiors”?

‘During the last week in June and _ the

under the auspices .of the National Board

various places throughout the Eastern part

of the United Stateg: Maqua, in Maine;
Silver Bay, on Lake Gere Eablesmere,
ii the mountains Pennsylvania; and in
Ohio. To these conferences the various
women’s colleges have been invited to send
delegates.

Previous to 1918, Bryn Mawr sent dele-

years we attended the conferences at Silver
Bay. This year we are invited to attend
the Eaglesmere Conference,

Last. summer Dr. Caulkins, Mr. Paul
Hutchinson, and Dr. Herbert Gray, of
London, were the speakers at Silver Bay,
while Dr. Coffin and Dr. Fosdick were at
Eaglesmere and Maqua respectively. All
the conferences ain the lectures stressed the
same main. ideas: fundamental points in
religion; for example; at ‘Silver Bay Dr.
Caulkins spoke on Relation of Religion and
Science, Divinity of Christ, Relation of the
Individyal to the Church, Question of a
Personal God; modern international Chris-
tianity,; social implications of Christianity.

The programs for the three conferences
were also rather similar. At Silver Bay,
Bible classes were held at 10 A.M. At
11.30 the conference was divided into vari-

As a very inactive member of the Lib-
eral’ Club'I should like to say first that a
Liberal Club should be almost, the most
valuable factor in college life; dnd _ sec-
ondly, that ours is at present an ineffectual!
though earnest organization. So at least
it seems to me. Instead of keeping our
campus life in touch with all the issues. of
the day which do not fall under the prov-
ince of the science clubs or the language
clubs as it ymight most helpfully do, the
Liberal Club is tending more and more
towards research and sociology; research
that seems a little advanced and technical
to any one who is not majoring in the_so-
cial sciences. And the conferences are he-
wildering — of us. They are often
difficult for“us to go to and their very’
little range limits the delegates who attend
them. .If we could have a conference here
at home more than once a year, it might
change our attitude of detachment. As yet
-we are unfamiliar with the methods of
conferences and uncomprehendirig of their
results. But I think that a few more
speakers on cultural subjects would be of
equally great value to us. The very name
of the Liberal Club suggests ari unlimited
scope for discussion. Why do we not hear
about the really arresting problems and -
coveries of our day? “

Of course it is impossible for a a
members alone to run a club successfully

and kratify the interests of all its members. |

The fact is that the enrollment af the Lib-
eral Club is about 66 and the average at-
tendante at meetings about 15. Now the

Té the Editor of THe CoLLEGE News:

Of course we all see the advantages of
conferences. We say, that through them
we meet students from other eplleges, get
other people’s points of view and after an
intense discussion and much hard though
often succeed in@settling some: question ot
mutual interest.

I dare say there isn’t a person .in col-
lege who hasn’t heard of conferences and
yet I wonder how many of us actually
have been benefited by then. It seems to
me that. our attitude is always, “Let’s go

As far as I know: only one has
been held at Bryn Mawr this year, while
nearly every week-end a carefully selected
group of delegates has trouped off to other
colleges. Even when our own Liberal Club
has helped to plan and organize a confer-
ence we have had to go to Swarthmore.

Often, I must admit, we have all been
invited as guests. In point of fact, how-

Of course; in a Students’ Building 're-

This year’s Social Service Conference,
held at Mt. Ivy, New York, on the week-
end of April 25, 26, 27, promises to be our
last opportunity to get the intercollegiate
point of view on social work. The Con-
ference is under the atfSpices of the Inter-
collegiate Community Service Association,
and as Bryn Mawr’s resignation from the

“Association is to take effect immediately

after the conference, Bryn Mawr delegates
will not be invited next year.

The I. C. S. A.’s proposed program as
recently outlined by its president is pro-

This year, under the auspices of the
Christian Association, we have had a
chance to estimate the value of discugsion
groups as a means “for developing gur
initiative in thinking fo® ourselves.. We
have talked at length with Dr.. Fitch, Mr.
Fearne, Mr. Simpson and various Sunday
evening speakers, and haye often been so
confused with the successive interpreta-
tions of different points of view, that the
discussion groups, as. a whole, - have ~not
been quite as satisfactory as’we had hoped.
Many have found that they are too apt to
be swayed-by the last speaker, because of
their, inability to assemble the ideas which
they have thought out in connection with
previous speakers. ;

As a partial solutior to this problem
whieh the discussion groups have created,
the ‘Christian Association Board suggests
the following plan, and hopes that members
of the Association will express their opin-
ions regarding it, to next year’s Board:
That the week-end conference be led by
two or three persons representing very
different points’ of view on whatever sub-
ject be chosen for thé conference. Each
leader should have a chance to present his
Lopinions, and then there should be general
debate in which both students and leaders
should take part. (We do not believe this
would turn into an argument between the
leaders alone.) In this way we should be

arguments, and to form ideas, and per-
haps reach conclusions, in the presence of
many more facts than formerly.

As an example: there seem tobe, at
present, two types of people who are think-
ing and working for. the betterment gf all
social conditions ; those who work through
groups and institutions, -and who believe |
that by changing conditions, people will
improve; and those who believe that the

INTERCOLLEGIATE SPEAKERS
BUREAU IS PLANNED

Speakers on Economic’ and Sociologic
Tcpics to Be Available ~



Plans for an Intercollegiate Speakers’:
Bureau, through which it. will be possible
for undergraduate organizations to secure
speakers for all their meetings with little
effort and at low cost, are being devised by
a committee representing four different col-
leges and universities.

The Bureau will probably cofifine its
efforts to the field of economic and soci-
ologic topics for the first year of its exis-
tence. Prominent speakerse and leadérs
representing all parties and all schools of
thought will be available through the Bu-
reau. ‘These men will be furnished at un-—
usually low figures, transportation being
the only charge in many cases, as the Bu-
reau will be conducted on a co-dperative
basis. :
t—Fhe Bureau will be definitely formed at
a conference of delegates from colleges in-
terested in the project, which will be held
at the Student Forum Headquarters, 2929
Broadway, New York City, on Saturday,
April 26. The committee has issued an |
open invitation to all organizations who
might userthis bureau to send delegates to
this conference.

The committee which is working on plans
for the bureau consists of W. R. Sassa-
man, Haverford College, Chairman; Mar-
jorie Marston, Vassar College; Bernice

now remains to get a sufficient number of
volunteer workers” and all should ~~ run
smoothly,

This summer Bates is to open on Friday,
June 6, the day after commencement exer-
cises. The first week is to be clean-up
week. In this time the house will be
cleaned and swept, curtains put up and the
rooms: made ready for the first group of
children who come on June 16. These are
the Kindergarten children ranging from
six to eight years of age. The children
come in groups of forty, each group stay-
ing for two weeks. The next group will
be half nursery, aged three to five, and half
six to eight year children. The last. group
coming from July 16 to August 31, will be
nine to twelve year old children, but this
year no boys over ten and no girls over
twelve are coming, which considerably
simplifies the problem of disciplining the
older children.

Everyone who is able to go to Bates
House this summer is urged to sign up.
For the more workers there the less work
for each individual worker. A few peo-
ple have misunderstood about volunteer
work at Bates House and thought that
some kindergarten or .child training was
necessary. But this is not so. Anyone
who wants: to go to Bates House is priv-
‘ileged to sign up. Workers are urged to
go for two weeks if possible, as this en-

--ables them-to-get to-know-the-children,-and-

gives the children time to know: theri
Those who only stay a week or less
scarcely get acquainted with the individual
children and the daily routine before they
leave, and so miss half the pleasure whi
Bates House can afford. a

unteers are asked to sign as soon as pos-

“Such gonferences, of course, seem to me
one of the amusingly futile creations of
this conferential age”—this was given, me
as honest opinion anent the. Interracial

Conference held’ at Swarthmore April 11,
12, and 13, but went on in conclusion to

amend, “but the problem is one well worth
thinking about.”

That’s just it—we as. intelligent people
must think about problems so that later on
we can act. Faced with a problem like
that of race it seems that the thing to do
is to talk it over, and how can that be
done adequately except in conference?

It is in conferences that you can say what
you honestly think: with the best assurance
of its having some effect. It is in con-
ferences that the ever present other side can
get counter: opinions at first hand, and the
process is reciprocal. The Swarthmore
conference, small as it was and unofficial,
did not, to use general terms, “accomplish”
anything. That is ‘to say, no immediate
arid transcendent measures ensued,” but
what seems to me all important an intel-
lectual road was opened. White men and
women talked with black men and women
about an interactive problem. There was
on the whole little argument and surpri8-
tngly little idealizing; facts were earnestly
hunted. for-and-honestly looked at. -For a*
good many people there the experience of
meeting negraes as thinking being to think-
ing being was new. We learned at first’
hand something of that often referred to
intelligensia of the black race—and were

forced to recognize them as our equals.

This method of procedure seems to me
to be the sensible starting point for a work-
ing out of any problem, for patently the
individual cannot run the world—by these

| student conferences we will be able to
‘|}amalgamate our student opinion so that

upon it—the preliminaries being at. least
started. : :

I think that any one who was present
at a meeting of the Interracial Gonference
will agree or admit that a step forward
was made—not perhaps in the great na-
tional and international question of black
and white, but in the segment of it that is
ours. And each segment so treated again
and- again will eventually, of course, make
one*big step. ee

In a college which has always some burn-

to be the degree to which the News rep-

just or representative to send out as an

opinion of the undergraduates an essen-
tially one-sided and uninformed criticism
of anything which interests so wide a pub-

As concerns the actual facts of the case,
it is hardly to be expected that the stu-
dents who unanimously voted to give May-

Day for the Students’ Building and the

Music Department should criticize the
“commercial” tone of it a few months
later, and should express themselves in

print as opposed to the “carefully planned
publicity” which has been, obviously, the
intended purpose of necessity accom-
panying the giving of the fete for a bene-

fortunate weather, was given us by the
Press, and although it gave publicity it was
not commercial by virtue of its being, so
to speak, a gift.

Expenses of another pageant, another
green, could never be cleared by a small
sale of tickets, but by reducing expenses,
and so being able to reduce ticket rates the
beautiful thing which Bryn Mawr works
to create can be opened to more people
(suggestions for the next May-Day are,
of course, being left with the records).
Meantime, we would like to offer our
thanks to the Press for its space, and
particularly to express our gratitude to
Mrs. Chadwick-Collins.

Those of us who have been in college
for four years have been privileged to
watch the beginning of the passing of
Class Spirit as a mattér of paramount im-
portance. We have hoped that it was a
straw, albeit a small one, which indicated
the departure of a much greater evil—
that of over-organization.

The student comes to college an indi-
vidual, or at least the raw material of one.
She has not been here a month before
she finds herself divided up into innum-
erable little units; she is not only a mem-
ber of the college, she is a member of at
least three associations, probably of vari-
ous clubs, committees and discussion
groups all of which plan a systematized
raid upon her time, strength and freedom
of choice. She is obliged to do her work,
play her games, sing her songs, express
her loyalties, even choose her friends ac-
cording to a complex schedule of proce-
dure. She is allowed neither the pleasure
of spontaneity, nor the dignity of choice.

The evil of this is manifold. First of
all it defeats its own ends and. actually
hinders the enterprise it seeks to help.

Secondly it tends to unfit the student
for life after college by making her de-
pendent upon many artificial stimuli for
her actions, by making her four years of
undergraduate completely unconnected
with anything she may choose to do in
the future.

Thirdly it makes college a less pleas-
ant as well as a less worthy place in which
to live. From a place of hard work, fruit-
ful leisure, and enjoyable freedom, it be-
comes a place of bewildering confusion in

Social Element Supplied by the Colleges.

The social side of: Oxford-is-a thing by
itself. There is practically no bridge be-
tween the Colleges and the town; and the
few stray souls who visit the elderly ladies
of North Oxford at tea time on Sunday
afternoon getrerally do*so"" under the-com-
pulsion of duty. There are no fraternities
—perhaps the Colleges provide on a large
scale that intimacy which fraternities and
clubs provide in the United States. But
there are innumerable clubs with some
purpose-—;Liberal, Conservative, Dramatic,
Sporting, Literary, Scientific—with a
membership drawn from the whole Uni-
versity and with small club rooms of their
own.

social pretensions, stands the Oxford
Union, Generations of ‘Oxford men have
belonged to it, many of the leading states-
men of the British Empire have fought
political battles and gained their first par-

doubt whether the House of Commons
itself has been the scene of more bitter
skirmishes than have taken place in the
‘Oxford Union.

It is so pre-eininently bound up ‘in the
history of the University and in the long
tale of British politics ‘that all-of us who
}were in Oxford in 1912 were proud be-
jyond measure that an American was
,elected for the first time to be its: presi-
ident. Certainly the United States never
‘sent.a more worthy representative abroad
than Bill Bland, of Kenyon and of Lin-
‘coln College, Oxford. Hé gave up his
life in France.

,. War Wound Still Unhedied.

I sei Oxford intimately before the
‘war, and I went back again in 1919. Out-

'morial buildings stood there. still, the
‘streets gave mutch the same appearance
as before. Here a new tradesman had
come to take the place of a favorite
‘tobacco shop; therg one might see a relic
‘of the days when Oxford made soldiers
instead of scholars. .But the lawns were
‘clipped and green, the river flowed as
softly as before, and the rain was falling
las ‘relentlessly as if it -had not stopped
‘once during the intervening years.

, Anew generation of men were in resi-
\dence—somewhat more seriowsS in their
purpose, somewhat: more restless against
ithe old txaditions, somewhat more revo-
‘lutionary in their insistence that the cur-
‘riculum should be brought “up to date.”
‘The older men who had been.at Oxford i in
‘other. years went again about their works,
‘but as they went they walked apart,.as if —
‘to speak with those whom they. had
‘spoken with before the war. “Time is a
‘gentle healer,” I repeated to myself. _

they rarely meet the standard of the Glee
Club performance, which represents the
combined efforts of the whole colthagre:4
And this matter of Glee Club is pertinent
to the question: No matter how ardently
the college may enjoy Gilbert and Sulli-
van, the unmusical majority recognizes
its limitations and does not feel injured
at being omitted from the *cast-'of Patience
or The Mikado. The same principle should
apply to dramatics.

‘There is no doubt. that individual class
plays, considered as collegiate dramatics,
often meet a very high standard. But in
the best of them, there are atways many
unnecessary imperfections—imperfections
which would be avoided by centering the
best efforts ‘of the -college in ’Varsity
Dramatics. By such a centralization, the
choice of plays’ would be far less limited.
One.would no longer have to choose
those which were suited to the’ particular
capacity of the class in question. There
would no longer be a necessity for large
casts. Instead, the range and scope, as

On a practital basis, if for no other}
reason, ’Varsity Dramatics would be ex-
tremely valuable. Not only would they
result in better plays, but in a*saving of
money, time and nervous energy.

The college, and especially those who
have been connected With the financial
side of play production, realizes how
great is the expense involved. Often, the
receipts are not sufficient to cover the
outlay for staging. costumes, programs,
and _the like. In Glee-Club_this-_is seldom
the case. And it is not only the size of
the cast which brings a large audience
of friends and. relatives—an audience
larger on each night than at the single
performance of any class play—but the
comparative certainty that Glee Club will
give a finished and creditable production.
Tn addition to larger receipts, centralized
committees for costumes and_ properties
could not fail to save money.

And as for time, in college it is ‘of
supreme _importance,.._Outside~ activities,
even in so valuable a form as dramatics,
necessarily incroach upon academic work.
But in the production of class plays, an
unwarranted amount of time and energy
hy expended—often by people whose first
interests lie elsewhere. If there were
*Varsity Dramatics, those who were gen-
uinely interested could pool their: re-
sources of talent and experience. Inev-
‘tably, less time would be wasted.

After all, Bryn Mawr is not a large
college. and the field is severely limited at
best. In order to make the most of our
dramatics, we ought to substitute for a
fruitless division of labor, a unified effort
to produce something worthy’ of the
“slorious whole.”

“New Morals for Old,” a series of articles

published in the Nation. ° ’

The test of morality, surely, lies in what
is good—good- for man and for society.
Who, then, is there who has arrogance
enough to stand up and define off-hand what
is moral and what is not? Who is so wise
as to say definitely how any particular insti-
tution will\effect human welfare?

Forgetting the. broad significance of
morality, however, we cuddle down under -
our petty -conservatism—and-refuse-to—con-
sider such “immoral” questions as: Is mar-
riage a good system? Just because it has
served a good purpose in the past, should it *
never be changed or developed in the future?

The idea of morality as a progressive
rather than a static system led the Nation to
publish through the summer and autumn a
dozen articles entitled “New Morals for Old
(still to be found on the shelves of the
magazine room).

According to this series of articles, to
which many keen and responsible minds such
as Bertrand Russell and H. L. Mencken
have contributed, marriage was an arbitrary
institution established during woman’s phy-
sical inferiority to man, a bargain by which
man gained something and woman gained
something else. - Its--expediency made —it
moral. But with women’s new economic
freedom have come new needs to be met.
Marriage, surviving longer than.the need of
marriage is, according to the Nation, no
longer a moral institution.

‘

True morality, must come from within,
not be imposed from without. Force a man
and woman to live together after they have
ceased to love each other, and you produce

_{no beautiful, happy or desirable situation.

What the world needs now to make it a
saner, cleaner place, is greater friendship
between the sexes, friendship without strain,
artificiality or prudish duplicity. “It is be-
cause gaiety and morality are thus divorced’ ~
that- gaiety becomes sordidness, morality.
dreariness. Not until men and women
develop together with legitimate interests—
will both men and women be free to achieve,
if they can, rich and unified personal lives.”

‘What would happen to civilization if mar-
triage were abolished or radically modified?
One writer asserts that man would become
much healthier biologically and less morbid
sexually. It is, however, impossible to tell,
Faith in progress, like faith in anything else.
is a glorious gamble. Those people whose
conservatism rests on fear of the unknown
are of the tedious type who wear overshoes
in dry weather. The world will never pro-
gress if people narrowly shake their heads
at each new proposal.

fellowships will be awarded for study and
‘research broader in scope, and in more

Supplementing Rhodes

“I want to supplement the great Rhodes

and for women as well as men,” an-
nounces Mr. Guggenheim. ‘Furthermore,
I want to make it possible for these per-

country in the world where they can work -
most profitably.” ®

There is no age limit to the fellowabive,
They are open, the announcement says, to
men and women, married or unmarried,
of every race, color and*creed. They will
be available to students older than those
to whom the Rhodes Scholarships are
open, including youg professors on sab-
batical leave, holders of fellowships from
individual colleges, and those who have
won distinction in graduate study.

No restriction will be placed on subjects
to be studied or the place where study is
to be pursued. The fellowships will be
open not only to candidates engaged in
research work along academic or artistic
lines, but also those interested in the
working of foreign systems of govern-
ment, in the study of social or business
conditions or in productive scholarship in
the fields of learned professions.

..€ amount of money available for
ea... fellowship will be approximately
#2500 a year; depending on individual
needs. Ordinarily the appointments will |
be made for one year, but in special cases
plans involving two or three year’s study
will be considered, ;
The first national award will be made
for the academic year, 1926-27. It is
planned after the\first year to maintain
annually from 40 to 50 fellows abroad.

The writers of this letter are Alumnae
who still keep their interest in what happens
in college. We read the News regularly and
have followed with great interest the changes
of the last few years as recorded in that
mnniscient and increasingly-colloquial sheet.
We have often been moved to think back
over the days characterized by “ancient, out-
worn tradition.” We remember, sometimes
a little shamefacedly, that we often enjoyed
attending meetings; that some of us went to

chapel and actually felt we could profit
thereby ; and that—horrible dictu—-we some-
times indulged in interclass demonstrations,
and shouted (ourselves hoarse with childish
glee in answéerto side-by-side: songs.

An editorial in the last News entitled
“Chance” has succeeded in arousing us from
the gently philosophic attitude which has
been ours. We feel stirring within us: the
instinct, not exactly to defend our poor out-
worn: traditions, but to question the com-

I noticed in the last issue of your publi-
cation a notice to the effect that the Varsity
Dramatic Committee interids to produce for
its first play Ice Bound, by Owen Davis, I
want to suggest that this choice‘is in-
auspicious, to say the least. A new or-
Fganlization must be ultra-conservative in
initiating its actions to escape censure,
and I feel that the committee has over-
looked this important point.

I saw 7ce Bound when it was’ produced
in New York two years ago, and have a
very vivid recollection of it. It certainly
seemed hardly the type of play that Bryn
Mawr would care to sponsor. The im-
promptu skit, or the Gilbert and Sulli-
van comic opera have seemed perfectly
permissable for light drama, but in the
more serious* vein, the productions whose:
success I have on occasion witnessed
have always been a wise selection from
the dramatic classics. A deviation from
these plays of unquestionable morality
seems ill-advised. Surely histrionic abil-
ity can be equally well displayed in plays
whose matter is less sordid and revolting.

Student Strike Threatens at Wabash.

Rumblings of discontent are becoming
louder and louder at Wabash College
over the Trustee ruling banning student
owned automobiles. A “pep” meeting
before the Purdue football game quickly
turned into an indignation meeting when
Dr. Mackintosh, President of the col-
lege, announced that no student would
be permitted to drive a car from eight
o’clock Friday night. Here. the student
body voted unanimously to strike if some
violator of the rule is expelled from col-
lege.
* When interviewed by a Bachelor reporter,
the members of the Executive Board of
the Trustees refused to give their per-
sonal reasons for desiring the abolution

{of “Campus Cans.” ,

The Wabash Bachelor student pullilicas
tion carries complete stories of the affair.
In its editorial column it lashes the trustees
unsparingly. To the plea that the enact-
ment of a law makes it right, the editors
have this to say: The enactment of a law
or ruling does not make it. right, and col-
lege students, as well as anyone else, have:
a perfect right to object to rules that they
deem unjustifiable. When an autocratic
body makes laws for the mass without the
consent of the mass, then is it right? The
trustees are trying to force an objectionable
rule on the students, and they hav right
as United States citizens to object. Con-
sequently they have taken the only weapon
in theire grasp—the strike—and have sig-
nified their intention of using it, if the need

We wish to protest against the prison-
house which the reading-room of -the Li-
brary has ‘become this semester. We
ask that it be made a work-room again,
not a torturéchamber of tongue-tied fear.
We hold no brief for the pleasant revelry
of ‘the last year; the chewing gum booth,
the light lunches and the poker games need
not be resumed. Most: of the leaders of
that festive period have left college; their
places will not, easily be filled. There is a
middle ground between pandemonium and
panic-stricken. silence. We point out. that
in past years the college prospered on this
middle ground, where one person may
speak quietly to another without any un-
due disturbance. We recall the remarks of
Mr. Pillsbury on the value of, slight dis-
tractions during attention to “work (see
Esséutials of Psychology, pages 134-135).

We ask the internes of the Lib. if
the shrieking silence is really helping their
work. Are they getting better marks than
at this time last year?
results of midyears will indicate an appre-
ciable improvement in college work. We
remember that 1928 graduated with one of
the best academic records; and in 1922-23
social life in the Library was allowed to
exist in a quiet way. After all most- of
the desired conversations are business, not
gossip. An atmosphere of industry and

‘freedom makes the Lib. - something bet;

ter than a bleak row of reserve desks, the
study hall of a female seminary.

Since a little distraction: is “often valuable
to attention, since the college has prospered
in the past with less restriction, since there
is a happy medium which can be main,
tained, and since it is hardly fair to ex-
pect the Self-Government Board constantly
to expend time and energy acting as police-
men, we ask a modification in the stringent
restrictions.

In reply to the criticism of Pillowship
heard in several parts of the campus we
point out that the skit has not been quite
fairly Considered. It has been criticized
from a biased attitude. It has been accused
of “having only one metaphor” (and that
an “objectionable” one). We remind the
audience that-out of seven scenes, four
(scenes 1, 4, 5 and 7) had nothing to do
with this metaphor, Is it fair to condemn
an entire production for. dislike of three
scenes (2, 3 and 6, we presume) ?°> We
should also remind ourselves our accusérs
that there was’ no reference, even in a sin-

necessary to give the men, a raw meat

huge chunks. In olden times, they are re-

Finally they arrived at Adis Ababa, the
capital of Abyssinia, although it consists
of nothing but mud huts. At one end are
the British quarters and the palace {also
composed of mud huts) and at the other
are the native habitations. The Abys-

The market place of Adis Ababa was
very interesting, but unfortunately food
was not sold as already they had réached

scarce. Adis Ababa also boasted a prison.
It is usually empty, however, since the
prisoners are not fed. Severe crimes are

punished, moreover, by slow. strangula-
tion.
“Abyssinia,” said Mrs. Forbes, “is the

only place awhere women do little talking.
The reason is obvious—they are required
to speak the truth.’ At each wedding
there must be two guarantors for the hus-
band, while the bare word of the wife is
sufficient. In the event of any trouble, the
wife is then always summoned as a witness

she should then:lie, the judge has her

Along the way they stopped at Lalibaba,

might be called the Jerusalem of Abys-

Hough-

The latest book by the author of The
Tree Hostages is not so much a mystery
story as it is a tale of daring sport in the
game preserves of Scotland. Three gentle-
men, confessing ennui at their distinguished
London careers, resolve to do the equiva-
lent of “stealing a horse in some part of the
world where a_ horse: thief is usually
hanged.” Poaching is the best bet, so the
following letter is composed and: serit tg
three respective owners of. estates in Scot-
land:

“Sir, I have the honour to inform you
that I propose to kill a stag—(or a salmon,
as the case may be)—on your ground be-
tween midnight on —— and midnight ——.
The animal, of course, remains your prop-
erty and will be duly delivered to you. It
is a condition that it must be removed
wholly outside your bounds... . I have
the honour to be,

“Your obedient, humble servant,
“JOHN MACNAB.”

The three desperate characters move to
the lodge of Sir Archibald Roylance—“that
ebullient young man”—which adjoins the
threatened sanctuaries, and the rest of the
hook describes the secret assaults, Gilles
und navvies are called to the defense of the
indignant property holders and every vul-
uerable spot of forest land or salmon stream
is watched, The description of killing the
salmon is a delight to every earnest and
scientific angler :

“But now his tactics were different. So
soon as the fly had floated past where he: be-
lieved the fish to be, he sank it by a dex-
terous twist of the rod-point, possible only
with a short line. The fly was no longer a
winged thing; drowned away under weter,
it aroused in the salmon early memories of }
succulent nymphs... . At the first cast
there was a slight swirl which meant that
a fish near the surface had turned to fol-
low the lure. ~The second cast the line
straight—and moved swiftly upstream.”

The book has much to offer besides plots,
suspenses and culminations. There are de-
lightful portrayals of Scotch ways and

And there is a romance, of course,

Last week’s editorial said that Bryn
Mawr “wishes its students to feel that
they. are adults capable of thinking for
themselves.” To me, the error of the
whole argument seems to be in the one
word “thinking.” A person may be per-
fectly capable of thinking for herself,
and yet lack the pertinacity— involved in
acting for herself.

Let us suppose, for the sake of argu-
ment, that, if deprived of all supervision,
we should prove to be incapable of act-
ing for our own best interests. In this
case it would seem to be the duty of the
college to try to fix in us the proper
motor habits, and to fix them so firmly
that they could withstand all antagonistic
tendencies. Fortunately we have not yet
passed the habit-forming age, and so there
is still hope for us; and even those. advo-
cates of free-thinking must surely agree
that the more we can lay: aside daily
actions by turning them into useful habits,
the more time we can devote to the less
regular tasks where independence of
thought is essential.

So far the ‘case has been merely
hypothetical. If all undergraduates were
capable, not only of. thinking but of act-
ing, for themselves, and if they chose to
expend this mental effort in the accom-
plishment of everyday duties, there would
indeed be no need for compulsory athlet-
ics (although I cannot help thinking how
childish: it is to quibble about the signing
or not signing of periods which you claim
you would do in any case). On the
other hand I think we all realize that the
need of bodily exercise is as real and as
vital a. need as that of mental exercise,
and that this need must be taken care of
either by the students or by the authori-
ties. We recognize the fact that some
students find it very difficult to make a
strenuous physical effort after studying
hard for several hours; but it is at this
very time that we need the most vigorous
exercise, and often the weariness they
feel is due more to lack of sleep than to
anything else. :

It is, then, admitted that we must have
exercise; and I believe it is realized that
this exercise must be enforced either by
‘the student body as . whole or by the
gym department. What unparalleled opti-

eruption and when in 1914 the acids in
the craqer were examined they were
found to contain absolutely no boric acid.
Kilauea Boiling Porringer.

One of the most interesting volcanoes
is Kilauea in the Hawaiian Islands. If
you start at the seashore you will drive
thirty miles before arriving at the crater
which is a huge hole eight miles in dia-
meter. It is filled with boiling lava like
a pot of porridge, and is continually in
motion, glowing intense red and cooling
to a hard black rock in the cracks.
Every little while it. blows up, as it did
in 1890.

A story is told about Kilauea, that
during a-war, a division of 20,000 men
was sent out and never arrived. Later
another -division found them sitting
where they had been killed. Even now
their footprints can be seen where they
walked in the hot lava. before an out-
pouring killed them.

Kilauea boils —up—periodically,._There
was another explosion in 1924, when a
column two miles high was sent into the
air and with it large lumps of rock.
The only active volcano in this coun-
try is one in northern California. It
blew up a few years ago when melting
snow on the hot rock started the erup-
tion and huge clouds of water vapor
were blown off.

Vesuvius’ last eruption was in 1906.
A crater appeared which remained quiet
until 1914, and then a funnel was dis-
covered with smoke pouring out., In
1919 the funnel was covered by a cone
ejecting lava. 3

In the Aegean Sea there 1s a strange
island formation that is the remains of
an old volcano that blew up about 300
B.C. Traces of houses and Greek ruins

were discovered on it. A few years ago
it erupted again and is now still going.
The air around these islands is at a

at 169 degrees, Fahrenheit; a cloud

and noise, changing form every: minute,
and dropping htige stones.

As you are printing in this issue of the
CotteceE News a newspaper report of
Mrs. Tiffany's will, | venture to ask for
a litle of your space in order to peint out

_Jwhat seems to me the real significance of

such a bequest.

A woman of great social charm and of
marked ability, Mrs. Tiffany had perhaps
as close a connection with things which |

uate of Bryn Mawr. An ardent believer
in woinan suffrage, she was one of its
active supporters everi in the long ago
days when to support it meant to work
hard for it, and she continued ‘her work
after the passage of the suffrage amend-
ment as Regional Director of the New
York League of Women Voters. A
great admirer of Woodrow Wilson, she
was a member of the Board of Trustees
of the Woodrow. Wilson Foundation,
and, eager for international understand-
ing, she was one of the members of the
Executive Committee of the Foreign
Policy Association. In spite of these and
many other interests, it was to Bryn
Mawr that, with the exception of a‘ few
legacies, she bequeathed at the expira-
tion of four trust funds her entire estate.

Another Alumna, Mrs. Percy Jackson,
of New York City, equally well known
for her public work and at the time of
her death a year ago president of the
New York Consumer’s League, and, like
Mrs. Tiffany, a woman of very real dis-
tinction, also has left the larger part
of her estate, at the expiration of a trust
fund, to: Bryn Mawr. It may well make
us pause, especially those who may be
questioning the value of college training,
and consider what tributes “like these
mean when paid by women who must
have tested innumerable times during the
years since their graduation (thirty in
Mrs. Tiffany’s case and twenty-five in
that of Mrs. Jackson) the real worth



of the training given them by Bryn
Mawr.

Apropos of the subject of required
athletics, it’ Seéms to me that there are
two main reasons for the delinquency in
signing up, besides that of mere laziness.
which should not be allowed to count.
One is a general feeling. against the idea
of required athletics at all. Many stu-
‘dents declare that it is not the exercise
they object to, but the fact that they are
doing it for their “four periods,” and be-|

to take care of themselves. If exercise
were forbidden, it would immediately be-
come popular; if it were left to the in-
dividual’s discretion, probably as many
people would take exercise as are doing
ties have decided, doubtless correctly.
that exercise is essential to the health of
the student, and that she will not take
the proper amount if left to herself, there
must be some satisfactory way of seeing
that she does it. ee
Perhaps this can be done by removing
or modifying the second objection. That
is the inflexibility of the distinction be-
tween general and regular athletics. ff a
student enjoyed, say, tenriis, walking,
hockey and coasting, all pretty strenuous
forms of athletics, and had no time—for
the college days are crowded—to fit in
less interesting gym, I see no reason why
she should not be allowed to register all
four as her required exercise. If a stu-
dent plays a good game of tennis,, why
should she have to live through a winter



team? If this line were removed, I should
think that participation in games would

""| be more spontaneous, and all kinds of ex-



Jercise more willingly | indulged in; and

A college deprived of its tradition
would lose much of its charm and attrac-
tion. But,surely the value of traditions,
like that#f other antiques, lies not merely
in that they are old, but also in that they
are pleasing or useful. Bryn Mawr is
not a college over-burdened with old
customs, and of those she has, the larger
part fulfill both of these qualifications.
But there are exceptions to this, we feel
that C. A. Reception is one of them. No
useful purpose is served by it, it,is dread-
ed by. shy freshmen, and looked forward
to with open boredom by the ate of
undergraduates.. Almost everyorle would
like to avoid it, and many do. Its period
of usefulness has passed with the passing
of class barriers and other superfluous
formalities. It seems high time for this
tradition to die gracefully of old age.

Here is a suggestion. It seems to me
that the system of C. A. girls ought to
be changed. Last year only one hundred
and twenty-five people out of. the whole
college applied for C. A. girls and of
these ten did not return to college. Of
the remaining one hundred and _ fifteen
only five were graduate students. . This
necessitated many - undergraduates tak-
ing two new graduate students as well
as a freshman. This put all at a disad-
vantage. It ig difficult to be one of
several who are being “looked after”
and it is difficult to “look after” more
than one. Of the one hundred and fifty-
five new graduates and freshmen whose
names were enrolled (before September
15th, one hundred and fifty-two received.
letters. This good record does not show
a general ifiterest throughout the college,
but emphasizes the work and interest of
a_small minority. Still fwrther, a great
part of the C, A. girl’s former work is
done now by the welcoming committee
for by the time the upper-classman ar-
rives the freshman knows almost as
much about the campus and the college
at large as does her C. A. girl.

‘The work of the membership com-
mittee has changed dnd grown with the
institution of freshman week. Their
work could be made simpler if the fol-
lowing plan (or ‘ one Bropcnsle were
adopted :

1. Let every member of the ‘college
who returns in the fall feel her respon-
sibility towards the incoming freshmen
and graduates and be willing to offer her
services to them.

2. Let the. membership committee
send out handbooks and a , Short wel-
coming form letter telling each fresh-
man that there will be a welcoming com-
mittee to receive. her.when she arrives.
etc., and ‘télling every graduate about
the graduate club. : ‘

3. Let the membership committee
deal out arbitrarily the freshmen to the
returning upper-classmen and leave a
note for each upper-classman during
freshman week telling her for whom she
is responsible. In this way all would
be accounted for and each person would
have only one C, A. girl.

This plan is not by any means per-
fected, but it seems to me simpler and
irore direct than the older one. .

Is the tuneful presence of other classes
necessary at elections? No, we do not
think it is.

The faint murmurings of the few
people who will come to elections is in
no way a moral support to the electing
class. We are vaguely conscious that
the other classes are present, but the very
fact that we ofttimes blunder out a Latin
cheer to the sister class is proof that the
interest of the electing class is solely in
the elections.

Moreover, the attendance of other
classes at elections is authentic evidence
that few people are actually interested
enough to come. In an atmosphere of
forced activity, our ‘presence at such
secondary functions seems to be of little
or no importance,

Miss Stetson’s letter concerning the
present system of C. A. girls brings to
the fore a problem sufficiently interesting
to many of us to warrant some consider-
ation. It is quite true, as we must real-
ize, that the innovation of ,Freshman
Week lias changed things considerably.
It is also quite true that to. have more
than one C. A, girl or to be one of more
than two C. A. girls is trying. Therefore
why might not this suggestion simplify
matters? Instead of leaving the election
of the -C, A. weléOming committee to the

last when everybody is too preoccupied |

even to attend the election, and positively
too busy to attend the committee’s efforts
—why not elect this C. A. welcoming
committee early? By early, we mean
April or the first week in May, before the
election of the regular board. It might
be wise to have the old committee head
continue actiyg with the new committee
until after those board elections. The
two working together could make their
plans for the next fall.

The advantage of this idea seems to be
that the C, A. committee could start its

campaign, stimulate the necessary inter- |.

est, and gather together a group lafge
enough to sce to the entire. new class.
graduates and undergraduates. So matiy
people who otherwise would take C. A
girls, when approached at that last rush
meeting, get away without having settled
the matter definitely. Furthermore, it
might be made possible to continue the
personal-note-to-Freshman ,. idea. - The
form note would suffice ; but could hardly |
take the place.of the personal note.

greater liberty than, the ordinary man.
We think that Bryn Mawr holds sueh a

PAID-UP PARTIES

Will the High Potentate of Chi-
cago turn purple and froth at the
mouth if we advocate the importa-
tion of another English fad? We
really are not particularly Anglo-
maniacal but these new “paid-up
parties,” originated in London, seem
to us a very admirable idea worthy
of adoption into our midst. A guest
at one of these parties described it
as “just a little friendly gathering to
celebrate the fact that all ‘install-
ments have been ‘paid on the furni-
ture and piano.” If. this scheme
were adopted here we should not
feel obliged to confine ourselves to
installments-paid parties. nel the
payment of all bills of any \kind
seems to us a worthy cause for cele-
bration. We feel particularly strong-
ly on the subject just now, as we
contemplate our growing pile of un-
settled accounts. We know that
paying these bills will be a long-
drawn-out and painful process.
Others about us are doubtless in the
same disagreeable boat as ourselves
and will be precisely as jubilant
when the last cheque is signed and
,on its way. Then why not cele-
brations? We need more excuses

the remedy she suggests seems a bit
extreme. I feel that she has passed over
too lightly the fact that “required re-
ligion” is no réligion at all. Will those

of toleration and freedom of worship
consent to the-exertion- of such pressure?
Moreover, required chapel, even if only
once a month, would mean such endless
bookkeeping, cut cards and mechanical
devices that it would hardly be worth
the effort. Is there no other remedy?
Surely there must, be someone in col-
lege with enough ingenuity to think up
a way to mould public opinion. Would
not a little strong feeling in the matter
Jresult. in the millennium ‘of voluntary
attendance ?

I should like, through, the courtesy of
the Coiiece News, to express. the, grate-
ful feeling of the Class of ’97 for the un-
tiring and generous activity of Mr. ‘Henry
S. Brooks in connection with the installa-
tion of the organ.- When the organ was
so generously offered .to the college by.
Clara Vail Brooks, ’97, and accepted by
President Park for the college, there was:
a possible $3000 in sight to meet the ex-

penses-ox*the installation, the total.cost of -

which-.as--you may. remember, was: $8000.
Arrangements for financing the under-
‘taking were taken over by Mr. Brooks,
for the college was so. heavily involved
with Goodhart Hall that. it could not
then advance the money.
only undertook this responsibility but also
the.-very. exactifig and-difficult. task of
raising and collecting the money. Con-
stant letters had to be written, difficult
decisions made, and through it’ all Mr,
Brooks’ patience, sense of humor and
generous attitude, never varied. He
wanted nothing to mar “the serenity. of
the gift” which’*he so, much wanted the
college to. have and to enjoy. It is
with a deep sense of gratitude and
recognition of. his ,devoted interest in
Bryn Mawr that we of ’97 tender him
this. humble acknowledgment.

The two 5 leans which have appeared
in the-last two-numbers of the NEws on
subject of required chapel have
prompted me, as a member of the-C, A.
Board, to express’ one or two of my views
on the subject. ‘ .

In the first place, the “fact that roa A.
has not kept its promise as to the: num-
ber of “musical services” it would hold
is not entirely the fault’ of the Committee
on Religious Meetings.. The organ room
af Goodhart was not ready for use dur-
4 the first semester and the atmosphere —

- Taylor was overwhelmingly . dis-—
ows what musical talent we
could ‘produce. . Now that the organ is
available there seems to be numberless
objectors to our long-cherished plans.
The war lords of the niusic depart-

to

‘metit. seem determined to thwart us at

every move. They give in on minor.
points only and with great reluctance.
Our organist is under contract .to play
elsewhere on Sunday evening, so that
unless the time of the service is change
there can be no organ music. We are
not allowed an outside organist. _Doubt-
less*some regular arrangement --will be
made for next year which wilf include
the morning chapel services’ too; but in
the meantime WG, find ourselves in much
the same position that we were in last
year and that other C. A. boards have
been in for at least eight years back. .
My suggestion ‘for. next. year is that
the board plan to have only two speakers
a semester besides the traditional Christ-
mas and Baccalaureate speakers. On all
the rest of the Sundays musical services

should be held and led by various mem- _

bers of the undergraduate body. _

I think it would be a. very good idea
‘to swing to the opposite extreme from
this year and have too few preachers

""|come to the college than to continue to

struggle along under a slight modifica-
tion of the present arrangement.

I ‘think that required chapel would be
out of the question, . not. only because_ it
is entirely against the policy of the
Christian Association and of the college,
but also because it would merely smother
the difficulty temporarily. ,

Your correspondent of last week who
signs. herself. “A. Member of the Ci A:
Board” states that “the gvar lords (!) of
the Music Department seem determined
to thwart us at every move. They give
in (sic): on minor points only and with
great. reluctance.”

The exatt assumption implied in the
latter sentence is somewhat obscure. °In
regard to the determination of the Music
Department to thwart the C. A. Board
at every move’ may I say that, so far
from this being ‘true, the exact opposite
is the case. During the entire time I

have been at Bryn Mawr it has been my

gteat desire to hdve good and appro-
priate music in both Morning “Chapel
and Sunday Vespefs. Under. the old
conditions in Taylor Hall. this was im-
passible, as music suitable for religious

| services cannot be adequately. rendered

with pianoforte accompaniment, nor can
the choir. do its best. work without the
aid_of a conductor or a leader at..the
instrument,
Ever since the organ in the Music
Room was presented to the-College last
June I have been in negotiation with
President Park in an attempt to make
possible some arrangement whereby the
College could. have a permanent organ-

ist and choir for all Chapel services. |

President Park and I have done all” we
can in the matter and the decision now
rests with the Board of Directors.

It is because I wish to see the music
of Chapel put on a permanent and sub-
stantial basis that- I-do~-not™think® the
idea of having a few occasional incom-
plete musical services, like the one given
two or three weeks ago, will lead to any
solution of the problem.:

It is generally conceded that the domi-

nant note in the literature of today. is
‘realism, A thing may’ be sordid or ugly,
but: so long as it is real it is welcomed
as a. subject for the -novel, for the
drama, or’ for poetry. This is an age in
which no pretense fs allowéd, in which
the stress is laid particularly; on the
seamy side. And yet several Freshmen
have recently had their slight attempts
at realism held up before their fellows as
immorality and vulgarity.” Because, in a
drama of college life, they represented
girls in their Conversation together using
language a_ little more highly-colored
than would. be considered suitable ‘in the
classroom, though considerably milder
than might be heard in any actual study ;
because, in order to get a plot out of-the
undramatic life of undergraduates; they
‘described behavior not of~the—kind ap-
proved by Mrs. Grundy; they have been
severely and unmercifully censured, and
have been told that no lady, even if she
saw such things, would write about them.
And. the censure is basgfl, -not on the
tack of worth or the poorness of the
execution of the work, but on the bad
morality which it is said to show. .

NEW VACATION PLAN

the Dean’s undergraduate days, she said,
a great objection to the seven-day Easter
vacation was firmly overruled by the
faculty, and_ the News_retaliated- by-pub-1
lishing a poem which ridiculed the—de-
moralizing effects of this past week-end,
describing orgies of ice cream sodas and
matinees. As a matter of fact, the —
ulty was largely influenced in this latest
decision by its belief that very little work
is accomplished in the Thursday and Fri-
day after the present vacations, and a
five-day beginning would be much better
for all concerned. Let us be very~care-

At the risk of being accused of “count-
ing chickens before they are hatched,”
I should-like to suggest a use for the
indefinite sum of money \which we
gleaned from May Day. Rumors of the
amount~indicate:,that- it would be suffi-
cient to endow Goodhart. Hall with dra-
matic .equipment. Now that we have
the stage and auditorium, we really
should have scenery and lighting to
ie ag If possible, too, it would be

a great addition to the college if there
were.a-fund.to pay. for. good. coaching
in plays, Ariyone who took part in one
of the May Day plays will certainly
agree that the good coaching she was
given made a difference not only to thie
play, but to herself. If: the money were
put into this it would be possible to give
at least one really good play a year with*
out charging Broadway prices for ad-
mission.. Varsity Dramatics could then
offer something worth while to the col-
lege—a good play at a nominal price.,
May Day was primarily an artistic
achievement and so it seems only logical
that. the money made. should. be turned
back to make possible other equally suc-
cessful artistic achievements.

The article in fast week’s issue in re-
card to “overburdened consciences” has
called our attention to the fact that the
News has several times been over-hasty
in criticizing the college policies with-
out open-minded consideration of both
sides of the question.,,., :



‘If our’ consciences will work only



_pure joy of letting. ourselves. go-on
the hymns, and ‘some of us cannot
cross the campus on a sunny morn-
ing without bursting into song. ‘Tn
another part of this paper it 1s said
that song is the essence of the sum-
mer school; must we of the winter
mnie our prosaic ‘nature ?

INTRAMURAL ATHLETICS
The new athletic arrangement,



which promotes sunbaths to such an];

extent, has created a grave problem

for those of us. who are just over-

flowing with class spirit and a wild
desire to cheer and sing. if there
are more sunbaths our infallablé
- logic tells us that there will be fewer
class games, and who could be really
enthusiastic over interclass  sun-
. baths? Moreover, if we are in such
a precarious sjate of health that our
exercise must be so Jimited, surely
it would be dangerous for us to sit
outdoors in the -cold and—too often
wet in order to cheer and sing.
But our class enthusiasm must
have some outlet. ‘We would sug-
gest ‘interclass card or parchesi
tournaments to be held in-the shel-
ter of the smoking room. Cheering
would be wonderful here as it
would not. only encourage one’s
side, but; as in baseball, rattle the
opponents. “Pounce,” and a curi-
ous game called “Spit,” introduced
by the freshmen, would be good for
this purpose as they are very noisy
anyway. And thére is always
_ bridge, always.



under certain prescribed conditions, and
jour honor is kept, so to speak, in labeled
j cubby-holes, why was this matter not
orought up sooner?-—Why did” those;
suffering from “over-burdened —con-
. sciences” not object when given a chance
(Miss Petts asked us collectively and
individually -what we thought) instead
of expressing a narrow and inconsistent
peint of view in an editorial presumably’
backed by. public opinion? :
Exercise is as much a part of the col-
lege requirements as the academic work;
and, while the. authorities consider it
vecessary, this requirement must be met
under some system or other. Prabably
nothing would be easier than for the
gym department to take a roll call and
count our absences; it is only for us that
it would be hard. If attendance were
taken, we would each have to take our
three regular classes in their regular
hours, with no exceptions. Riding and
golf. could ‘not count (there are not
enough coaches to call the ‘roll at: Whit-
‘tendale’s and St. Davids!) It is only
with our co-operation that the present
ilexible system can be applied. |
Moreover, calling our attendance a
“high moral obligation” is a slight ex-
aggeratiom: it’ is merely a question of
‘practicability, for it we are notable to
‘lo our three periods by ourselves, of
Lecessity ‘the system will become more
rigid. In addition} those with “over-
4rdened consciences” may sign a special
list and have their attendance observed ;
but in that’ case no exceptions may be
made for them. The ” “psychologists”

As an alumna of the college and pres-
ent Graduate students I have had and do
still have work té doin the library. In
consequence I feel that I, havé a right
to make one or two small complaints.

Although I have heard some com-
plaints from various people who, use the
library Iwill pass them over in silence
and state only my, own: experiences.

The first thing that troubles ‘me is the
lack of interest and help that one often

Then the other situation that annoys

.me very much is the shutting up of the

library at night. Nominally,-I- know, the
building closes at ten, but the usual pro-

cedure is as follows: 9.30 or earlier, |

Dear Madam: I can’t resist the temp-
tation to send you a copy of an editorial
written by one of our sophomores, which
appeared this morning. It contains a
rather tasty allusion to spring activities
at Bryn Mawr. — .

Having somewhat well-defined inter-
ests in your part of the country, I’m all
in favor of a Bryn Mawr-Dartmouth
entente cordiale. Judging from the re-
sults of the senior: questionnaire, how-
ever, I’m afraid that considerable work
will have to be done first along the line
of better relations. In this questionnaire
Smith walked away with first place, with
seventy-seven yotes; Vassar came sec-
ond with | twenty-six, ‘ellesley third
With twenty-five, etc., After .read-
ing down the list awhile you strike
Wheaton, _ Goucher, _Emérson, _ Elmira,
Wisconsin, Barnard, Converse, Georgian
Court College, Randolph Macon, New
Jersey State College for Women, and—
Bryn Mawr. All with one vote..

It’s too bad.

you have learnedto waste bread and to
Spare labor. You are a country of
high wages, yet boasting a low cost of
production. “In this you have suc-
ceeded admirably and I hope that Eu-
rope will follow your example.
Accomplished by Machinery.

“How -have you done this? First of
all. by machinery; in this: respect you
have no conscious principle, but ob-
viously it’s there; if you do not dis-
pensé with the cost of labor you are
done. Secondly; you: have what we
call the Taylor System. which can be
briefly explained in the principle that
when you pay a:'man ten dollars you
manage to get ten. dollars’ worth’ of
work from him, or if ‘possible. fifteen
dollars’ worth. In America, by this
system, the ‘work- of. a man is used
most éntelligently. You cannot afford
to pay for inefficient labor with such
high wages. Thirdly you havé stand-
ardization;. Europe has not been stand-
ardized. Fourthly, »you have worked
for concentration. You have learned
that production must be concentrated
for thorough scientific administration.

“Now allow me to ask you. why you
have been able to do this when Europe
was not able. Primarily your natural
resources are responsible;’ secondly,
although you are the most protection-
ist country in the world, you enjoy a
huge amount of free trade from 120,-
000,000 consumers in your own United
States; lastly, there is the inevitable
‘standardization’ Which is resisted by
people in Europe. In America people
may hate it, but they. accept it because
it pays.

Europe Retains the Old.

* “Very..soon you will. be asking me
what I have to say of,Europe. Well,
Europe_is_exactly. the same—thing,..ex-
cept that it is the contrary. America
is massive and strong, Europe is
broken up and articulated; the United
States is a nation of States; in Europe
there are, many nations—each distinct
and individual. This is terrible from
the point of view of efficiency. In
America civilization is based on com-
mon conception of production; in Eu-
rope on diversity of people. In Europe
there is a small territory with’a dense
population, few natural resources and
many men. Accordingly, in Europe
the emphasis is placed on politics: how
to share the »production~ of wealth.
Therefore America is conservative
while Europe is. radical. Not even
China is so conservative as America.
As Churchhill has said if you want to
make a country conservative,: give it
something to conserve.

“The question is: how can Europe
compete with America? How- can. she
have a larger market? Perhaps by
doing what she is trying~to do now;
by forming ententes betweén countries
and suppressing the tariffs, thus mak-
ing a united market. Then she will

cess ully because of the low wage ‘sys-

‘tem: “Botay Fratrec’ competes with y=

America successfully only ‘in light pro-
duction—dresses, hats, etc., where the
value of the thing is small but. the
part the producer plays is great. In
such production it is necessary to rely
upon creative ability and the intefli-
gence of the working man. Machinery
cannot supplant this. We succeed when
we do. the opposite of Ford, when we
are individualists. So there is a whole
part of French industry where it would
be detrimental to follow American
methods.

aah C"" Europe the old civilization still
survives,” M. Siegfried said in conclu-
sion. “In America there is the new.
It is. my wish that these two coun-
tries, Europe and America, would not
try-to-copy each other or compete with
each other, but that they would ex-
change those magnificent values which
are, after all, the real basis _of civiliza-
tion in all countries.”

Alice—And what does that mean, pray

Rabbitt—
I thought I saw a motorcar
Parked near. to Taylor Hall;
I looked again, and saw the road
Was turned into a Mall,

Where gardened, clad as ; farmerettes,

~The former Vestals all.~

Alice—Indeed, these rows of flowers,
arranged, as I see the sign says, in class

Beauty hath returned,
Old, yet ever new!

Maiden—

At first I had fondly believed
The cause was the morning

Until this ear-sore was rémoved,
Aesthetics were in bad luck.
Rabbitt and Alice—Hear, hear!
Maiden—

But the Board of .Directors assembled,
“When Liberty’s form stood in view,”

Decided, in voices that trembled,

That, Motor, the brunt was on you!

FRESHMEN MAKE GOOD TRAINING COURSE GIVEN YOUNG IDEALISM GOOD



""A: crowd of swimming enthusiasts,
undampened by the memf fy of a 37-
13 defeat last year, thronged to the
pool on Friday, March 14, to witness
the Swarthmore meet. Both teams—
Swarthmore in their garnet suits, and
Varsity, resplendent in yellow caps and
new insignia—were properly applauded
as they marched forth to take their
places on the bénches under the clock.

The first event, the 40-yard fee

_style, went to Swarthmore, with a sec-

‘and’ Bernheimer,

-. son, Bryn Mawr, 1 min. 4 sec.;

_before.

: “Gold Diggers”

ond to Bronson, of Bryn Mawr. The
breast stroke followed, and Torrance,
who recently broke the college record,
who scored first
against Swarthmore last year, both
came in before Biddle, of Swarthmore,
thus putting Varsity four points ahead
of their opponents. The score was
more than evened in the 40-yard back
stroke, where both’ places went to
Swarthmore. When Bronson and
Grassi-captured—first-and—second:in-the
85-yard free style, Bryn. Mawr was
again put in the lead with a score of
20-16.

The diving on path sides lacked in
the finish and. grace: essential to pretty
work. Nickol’s Flying Dutchman won
the applause of the spectators as the
most ambitious attempt of the day.
Geare, who placed third last year, came
in first over Frothingham and Jackson
for Bryn Mawr.

The score, which was 24-21 for Var-
sity when the relay started; was turned
by Swarthmore’s success into a vic-
tory. The meet was closely contested,
and was a. great satisfaction after last
year’s defeat. Varsity is to be highly
congratulated on such a splendid show-
ing. Kruse deserves special mention
for continuing nobly in the relay after
she put her knee out.

The events were:

40-Yard Free Style—Won by Jack-
son, Swarthmore, 25 sec.; second,
Bronson, Bryn Mawr; third, Wardell,
Swarthmore.

49.Yard Breast Stroke—Won ‘by
Terrance, Bryn Mawr, 35 sec.; second,
Bernheimer, Bryn Mawr; third, Biddle,
Swarthmore,

40-Yard Back Stroke—W Won

by
Geare, Swarthmore, 31 sec.; second,

Walton, - Swarthmore;—third, —Fatlor,

Varsity Wins Easy
Victory Over Baltimore



The week of March 9 saw two glori-
ous victories for Varsity, after the ap-
palling defeat by Rosemont the week

11, the Buccaneers bowed to Bryn
Mawr to the score of 87-11, and on
Saturday, March 15, the. Baltimore
were overwhelmed
45-18.

In: the’ Baltimore game, although vic-
tory was too easy to try their mettle,
Varsity played good, if rather. slow,
basketball. Owing to the. weakness in

‘the center in passing, Bryn Mawr’s

“and preventing scores.



guards were kept.busy, and they did
beautiful work in intercepting passes
Their team
work was excellent, and they were fast
and sure. The forwards were equally
good, playing a steady, ,well-balanced

game and scoring on a large majority:



of their Shots. _

On..Wednesday~-night;-March

Co-operation and Finish



Under the auspices of the Bryn

Mawr League, a musical service was
given Sunday evening in the Music
Room of Goodhart Hall.
» The general run of these musical
services has been very enjoyable at
each presentation, and it ts with some
regret that we cannot say as much for
the more recent ones. The musical
numbers were chosen with great fore-
thought, and, had they -been rendered
in the usual excellent elermer by the
choir and organ, the result would have
been entirély . successful.

It seems a pity that the pléasantest
services should be ruined by poor de-
livery. We realize, of course, that this
cannot all be remedied.. The organ,
for instance, seems to need more radical
attention than any one of us, or Mr.
Willoughby, can offer. But the choir!
Surely .a little hard work, combined
with a little co-operation in presenta-
tion, would show an almost. miracu-
lous improvement.

The program this week was as fol-
lows: :

Processional Hymn No. 89—

“Saviour when in dust fo-Plice —

‘lo we bow the adoring knee.”

Choir—""O’er*the Smooth Enamelled

“Class spirit” is venting itself: this
year in contests in enthusiasm. Not
content with rivalling each .other in
athletics, the different classes are bent
now on outyelling each other. Clap-
ping, too, has become a serious busi-
ness; proficiency in it demands  train-
ing just as skill in dribbling tthées. One
must also cultivate an éxpression of
ecstacy to be assumed while one’s
sister class sings its Junior Song. For,
on the intensity of this ecstacy and on
the loudness of the subsequent ap-
plause- depends the standing of the
spirit of the classes. At least so the
classes seem to think, or, rather, they

sion. For, waiving the question as to
whether enthisiasm is a valid test of
class spirit, can’ any one really believe
that this sort of thing is enthusiasm?
Enthusiasm must be spontaneous.
is a vivid feeling, and must often. espe-
rcially when shared by a crowd have-a
lively outlet. There is no objection
to this.” The noisy kitid of enthusiasm
aroused by a close water-polo game
is the finest thing in the world. That
is because it is genuine. It is real en-
thusiasm. Organized uproar is not.

The Freshman gowns distributed on
Thursday were from two to six inches
too short. The gowns should be~six
inches from the ground: Some were
exchanged, some were altered, but
many had to be sent back. As a re-
sult of this mistake many of the Fresh-
men have not gowns and had to bor-
row them for Lantern Night.

Editorial: \We are told that when
the man who sent the Freshman gowns
was questioned as to the cause of their
shortness he replied, “All gowns are
worn short. this year.” Thus we see
the effect of fashion on everything.
Even the formerly dignified academic
gown has become tinged with the
spirit of the smock. Each year will
bring new changes. \ There will be hob-
ble gowns and hoop-gowns, empire
gowns and princess\ gowns. Future
generations may find this a relief from
monotony. For us old conservatives
it is, to say the least, shock.



Freedom, and More Freedom
It is interesting to note a recent
change in the Bryn Mawr cut system.
The record in’ their college News
reads: “A student is allowed only so
many cuts per semester as. she has
regular Courses per week... .. A stu-
dent taking ¢éxcess cuts up| to and
above her. individual allowance shall be
placed on student probation . » » and
is liable to have part or all of her
semester’s work cancelled.”

And what about the Goucher) “cut
system”? A minus quantity; we are
free of such. Instead of an allowance
of cuts per semester, we are encouraged
to take none, but we walk unforbidden
to take any number. Instead of stu-
ent probations and severer penalties,
“we go unfearfully, for the administra
tion devises no punishments for us.
This freedom is.-undoubtedly a
glorious thing, a thing to be proud

At anyy

seem to have. jumped to such a conclu-|.

it |""

so difficult that it, is the wise woman
who goes. Smith College uses this
system. President Robertson approves
it. It would imply dignity and ma-
turity on the part of Goucter-women,
not to ‘mention. scholarliness..and_in-
tellectual interest. An acid test, bit
we should expect a positive reaction.

Although I appreciate-the usual ex-
cellence. of the News comment, I am
forced to register-a~protest-expressing
complete disagreement with the recent
editorial on numerical marks.

One of: the News’ chief objections-to
numerical marks is the belief that they

}give an evaluation of the student's work}

less fair than the old honour point. sys-
tem, It is admitted that there was dis-|
satisfaction with the. previous arrange-
ment “where an werent credit minus

‘1 college

. | Casella—



student received a mark ten (numeri-

cal) points higher than the habitually
merit.plus:. But the News says that

the faculty is unable- to- make the-dis---——

tion of one or two points in: grading
‘work. ~ Nevertheless, — “the
faculty, since they voted the measure
in, presumably . wanted it.”
We are told that the new system can
give no reward to those intangible
qualities which may not be included
in the strict quizz and examination
average. Does it not seem obvious

that these extra-statistical achievements |
can be much better recompensed when °

a professor can add on two points,

which will actually count, than when’

he is faced with either a plus sign,
which does not help in the final ac-
counting, or an entire ten-point in-
crease? And the smaller the unit of
the mark, the more truly can he repre-
sent those qualities. This principle of
fairer differentiation holds for all
border-line cases, including the almost-
failure and the almost-pass.. And fair-
ness likewise. justifies “the humiliation
of a'mark in the 30's.”

The fact that faculty and students

are still thinking in terms of merits '

and credits does not, to my mind, prove
that the honour points are better, but
merely that we are not yet used to the
change. As to the: professor who
posted a 58—the case appears to be
one of misunderstanding the relation-
ship, between the new system and the
old, not of an immutable P-psychology.

The moral effect on the students is
a more difficult question. Neverthe-
less, I cannot see why a numerical
scale should lay more emphasis on
marks than did the previous mee hg
ment. There probably is somewhat
more bickering over a difference of a
few points now than formerly, but
that seems to me the unfortunate ac-
companitment. of what ~is otherwise a
great improvement. .

Finally, the whole question of mark-

ing systems-seems-rather-trivial: Need

we*bother our over-worked minds with
the’ long consideration of this purely
mechanical side of our studies which
would be necessary if we effected a
change? ~ ;

My suggestion would be that Sopho-

and that if a student’s work in half her
units shall fall below the old merit level,
she be put immediately on the cut limit

Dear Ladies: .

As an undergraduate in college I
used to marvel at the interest the
Alumnae displayed for your vehicle of

for it, but that was different.

I felt 1t a sort of sacred duty to keep

your chronicle as a record of the things
which were happening about me. But
these others puzzled me.

I spent last year away from college,
although I’m not yet an alumna, and
the reasonableness of this apparently
inexplicable phenomenoh began to be
clear, Perhaps you might be interested
in my own reactions to. the News from
a distance, although I had better add
that they were stimulated less by criti-
cism than by curiosity:

In the first place, the every-day re-
cording of the goings-on at college
gives the expatriat a sense of commu-
nion with the principals and their im-
mediate audience, whichis; alas; too
easily broken with the last view of:

7 ROK Arch. In the second, the. edi- |

torials and the letters written about

college problems help to. keep one,

aware of the spirit of friendly contro-
versy which characterizes the best
thought, and which is regrettably rare
vere are



probably right. The arrival ¢ of over a hundred new faces seems less and

Jess remarkable to the he .upperclassman as she sees it repeated it yearly.
‘This situation fortunately is confined to a short period. Therefore we

~-want to assure-you all that the-upperclassmen: will, sooner or later, evolve



into a tolerable sort of human being who is genuinely glad for the oppor-
tunity to be at college again and to make enthusiastic new acquaintances.

You Freshmen have been told frequently this summer that you are
very smart to be able to enter Bryn Mawr. You have been examined
and catalogued by every device known to man. You have been welcomed
by Miss Park and the Student Association and given lengthy assignments
-by-yourprofessors:”You~have-begynto find responsibilities clutching
you. We feel nevertheless that this-has not made. you full-fledged mem-
bers of the student body for Public Opinion has not yet acclaimed you.
The News hastens to take over this pleasant duty, and in its capacity as
the Voice of Public Opinion.to congratulate your infant class and wish

you well. |

This Thing Called Infantile \

It-is-net-often that-one has the pleasure, or at least the opportunity
to have the entire college at hand over a week-end. Usually the Big,
‘Happy Family is broken up, in a great rush for the 1:08. Now a wee
gerni (so they tell us), whose name, by the way, is much too long for
it, has come along to keep children from their parents, let us say, and
we must be content with only a foster mother.. Sometimes life seems
hard, but in this case not unfair as well. For, granted the initial risk of
letting us come back on schedule, there is little danger if we sit with our
fingers crossed and await the demise of the wicked germ. At any rate,
we are not complete prisoners, and Philadelphia, besides being compara-
tively safe, is rising to’the occasion with a number of amusements. As
for not receiving visits from those who are under suspicion as living in
an infected district, one cannot deny the wisdom of the course.

If the First. Frost keeps avoiding us, it might be desirable for the

college to establish an amusement park, or some such thing. The invet-
erate week-enders, not knowing how to work over a week-end, and too
proud..to_go.athletic, soon. ecoming- sated with sleep, might otherwise
break out into pie-bed making and other forms of the Practical Joke
to relieve themselves of the surplus energy.

At present, however, we are not too unhappy, and, what really
matters, we are teeming with health. Good: for us!

‘Dear Mrs. Manning:
Here I am in Munich, and very
comfortably and respectably settled.

This is-‘the women students’ dormitory
and. by far the cleanest, cheapest and
most wholesome way of living here.
Unfortunately the university is closed
for the summer holidays, so that I
have been compelled to study pri-
vately. For nine hours’ teaching in the
week, I pay. These consist of voice,
piano, music history and literature of

| the late Tomantic period. Four hours a

week I devote to language exchange.
The rest of the time I practice, study,
go around the city.

Munich is very beautiful and I love
it. Life here is much simpler than in
America—fewer conventions, und alles
ist doch so gemuetlich. Every one
says “Gruss Gott” and if you know a
few words like “fabelhaft” or “dunkles
Bier” or “sehr gemuetlich” then I
think you cannot be unhappy here.

I have learned to speak briskly and
be very direct about things so that |
don’t have to, talk in literary. German

I arrived was to buy a map of the city,

tively and personally, was most surprised
and pleased to find itself on the editorial
page of the CorteceE News. It/‘is a dis-
tinctly enjoyable sensation to. find myself
remembered in the old haunts.

However, I am sorry to have to dis-
appoint the News in its high opinion of
me, because I never did reach the ex-
alted state of editor. Cornelia Rose was
editor in 1928, and I was copy editor.
To balance this lack of glory, on the
other hand, the News can claim credit
for Caroline Smith, who was also on
Editorial Board in -1928. Truly, the
Week-end Book Service owes its all (or
at least two-thirds of itself) to the CoL-

It is important that some action be
taken in lengthening the amount of time
for milk lunch. Under the present sched-
ule, which--allowsonly--ten—minutes_be-

late to their next lecture or deny them-
selves entirely the benefit of extra nour-
ishment, and _a few minutes of relaxation.

classes straight through from nine until
one o'clock. -

It is not right for a (class lecture to
-be-in-a-prolonged-state-of- interruption by
late “milk-luncheoners”; nor is it sound
sense that a student forego milk lunch

in order to be punctual. Therefore, I



I speak partictlarly of students who have | _

propose the following change in the class
schedule :

8 :30 to 8 :50—Chapel.

9:00 to 9:50, 10:00 to 40 :50--Classes.

10:50 to 11:10—Milk lunch (twenty
minttes ). :

11:10 to 12:00, 12:10 to
as at present.

Beginning chapel on the- half hour
seems like a more logical time (at least
a more definite time) than, for instance,
8:40. Many students wait around after
-breakfast for chapel to begin. There are
some, however, who get down just at the
closing of the doors, and they might find
8:30 chapel a little annoying.*» On the
other hand, ten minutes longer for milk
lunch and time to read one’s mail would
make up for the inconvenience. ,

The pre-milk-lunch professors might
object to a sudden change in schedule.
But we compliment them by assuring
ourselves that they are broadmined
enough to see and meet the student's
point of view. °

Ten minutes for milk. lunch is nol
enough. No student on the third floor
of Dalton can return to her hall (whether
it be Merion or Rockefeller), partake of
crackers and milk hygienically, exchange
books, and in a-relaxed state of body and
""a receptive state of mind get over to the
hitisie™ room of Goodhart or the second
floor of Taylor.

And as for the post-milk-lunch pro-
fessors, who have'to put up with late-
comers, cracker-nibblers, and worn-out
students, what a boon it would be for
them to have a class mentally keen and
alert!

the direct result of something he et.
It is a matter of common knowledge

sto | that things which take years to kill a

human can do the trick on an animal
in just no time at all.. In any case,
our maiden ancestors had no scruples
at all.in falling on the warm carcass
of the fallen hero of the fortune, and
making hash of him on the spot.

The legend is that the meal thus
achieved was a_ veritable banquet of
the gods, and with its -ambrosial fra-
grance warm in their nostrils, fhe
maidens attacked the problem of
moose-feasts as a_ tri-weekly affair.
Plans were almost perfected when the
Dean of that decade issued a _procla-
mation prohibiting the hunting. of
meéese by the students or faculty on
the grounds that it would take too
much time from their work and sub-
ject them to too great a nervous strain
(the students, not the meese, although
there is something to be said for both
sides). Riding from class to class:on
tame meese was prohibited, along with
swinging on antlers, as a dangerous
practice. In short, the moose-incident
was turning out to be a mere flash in
the kettle (pan not being used at this
time). i

A little~baffled, put unwilling to ‘let
their=last- wan-hope -slip ‘f rom: sight,
the maidéis devised another scheme.
They took the head of this unfortu-
and mounted him above the doof, hop-
ing that other meese, moved by anxjety
for their brother or by the Same curi-
osity which had undone him, would
venture into the hall as he had done,
where they could be dealt. with in the
same way. : sore

It seemed an excellent plan, and
might easily have brought results but
for an unfortunate oversight. The
taxidermist neglected, in his efforts’-to
erase the death agony from _ the
moose’s face, to eliminate from his
eyes that look of wondering horror,
which may be seen*there to this day.
When, within a month or two, another
moose did come to stand without the
open portals of the hall, the dying look
of his fellow. warned him in the nick
‘of time, and he fled. Week after week
the maidens waited, but although now
and again a moose would stand with-
out the doors, none ever entered.

It became apparent that there had
been a mistake, but the community
was already appreciably-weakened and
there was no one who would attempt
to rectify it. Anyway, it had become
a tradition by this time, so they let
it go, and lived as best they could. on
the golden memory of one wonderful
night.

Quota,” published last week, which
clearly defines the pros and cons of
the present rooming situation, we sub-

is unsatisfactory as “an impartial in-

classes.” In the second place, we con-

class halls: to grow up.” And with
these two points in mind, we wish to
submit the following plan:

bigh be used as Freshman halls, with
a complete mingling of the other
three classes in the Pembrokes and
Rockerfeller. ~The advantages, as
they appear to us, would be as fol-
lows:

1, The Freshmen would have the
opportunity of becoming acquainted
with their entire class. Freshman
Week, 4s it is now organized, is an in-
complete attempt at accomplishing
this, because girls do not become gen-
uinely acquainted outside their own
halls in so short a time.

tensibly because the application for
renewal of the theatre license was
filed too late. The great Jimmy Walk-

to do with the sudden efficiency of the
license bureau, denied vehemently that
any political pressure had been used
to stop the license, and ended by say-
ing that he had heard that it was a
rotten show anyway. The producers
came right back and said they weren’t
interested in the reported dramatic
criticism by the Mayor’s: friends. The
whole business is pretty obvious, since
dozensrof other theatres are running
without licenses, but—they aren’t

I should: like to put before you
some facts about the scholarships sit-
uation for next year, which are pain-
fully apparent to us of the Alumnae
Scholarships Committee, and which
touch the undergraduates very close-
ly. There were 89 applications for
scholarships and grants this spring,
as compared to 65 last year; and
there is less money than usual to dis-
tribute in scholarships, grants and
loans. In consequence, 20 applicants
are receiving no help for next year,
except the $100 remission of tuition
in some cases. Of these students
there are at least 17 with records so
good that it would be a great loss to
the College if they could not return.
srhey would be greatly missed as in-
dividuals, as many of them play an
important part in undergraduate life.
The remedy for the situation, as we
see it, is the raising of a sum of
money to be held as a flexible fund,
administered by the Dean’s Office, and
used for grants or loans to students
in need of extra financial assistance.
The minimum necessary to help the
20 students is $3500; $5000 . would
scarcely cover the needs which are
likely to arise in the coutse of the
next year. It seems vitally important
that this fund be started, so that the
20 students and others who may ap-
peal later may be assured that they
will be able to stay in College next
year.

The growing dissatisfaction with

the service at the tea-house which I,

have lately noticed, has determined
me to turn to you for some help in
getting to the root of the trouble.
{| do not wish merely to complain of
the many objectionable features of the
tea-house, but to arouse the attention

of those who are interested in it and.

to have the matter definitely refer-
réd- to the responsible ‘authorities. It
is a fact that the tea-house is the most
convenient, in fact the only conveni-
ent and close “eating nouse” outside
of the hall dining rooms. We can go
to no other place in the comfort. of
gym and hockey clotnes. There is no
other ‘place in which: we may freely
lounge and sing and shout. Is it real-
izing our dependence upon it, that the
authorities take advantage of us in
making the prices unwarrantly high
and the service correspondingly bad?

Tor example, last night, at 6.30, we

arrived at the Inn; by 6.35 our order
for two chicken sandwiches, two bak-

Jed beans and two glasses of grape



tress because of drought, flood, forest
fire, tornado, snowstorm, miné\ explo-
sion, or other similar great disaster.

Prolonged drought caused the Red
Cross.to go with help to 58,000 fami-
lies. inthe Northwest. Here in 144
counties in North and South Dakota,
Montana, Nebraska, Washington and
Iowa the Red Cross spent $1,980,000
from its own treasury to feed and
protect people through the winter and
spring.

The Red Cross always maintains a
state of readiness to ‘meet these sud-
den emergencies, and funds and other
essentials to this work are supplied,
in part, by the annual roll call, held
each year from Armistice Day to
Thanksgiving Day. Every citizen can
support this worthy activity through
joining as a member in the local Red
Cross chapter.



juice was in. One hour and twenty-| house, where a substantial and edible

live minutes we waited for: our order
to be filled. When it did come, we

found that we had to content our-
selves with chicken salad sandwiches
and orangeade, as they were “just out
of” chicken and grape juice. We had
to call for spoons and napkins. The
price of this meal was $.80. Why
does such a crying state of things
exist? Charging the very high prices
they do, is there any excuse for fur-
nishing such inefficient service? Are
the kitchen accommodations too small;
is there not sufficient help? I have
often eaten at small resaturants
charging half as much as the tea-

meal’is Srved with decency and speed.
is clatter and confusion.
Where does the trouble lie? I ask not

rhetorically, but for information. And
if it is beyond your powers of calcula-
tion to answer, as it is beyond nine,
then I should like to know to what’
higher authority I can régister my
complaint with some assurance of its
being attended to. Who runs, or
rather, neglects to run, the tea-house?

A recent editorial in your paper has
called attention to the subject of cam-
pus dress. You plead for cleanliness.
Who can quarrel with you there ex-
cept to say that we are clean already?
You plead fér tidiness. Your case
for this, I think, is not so strong.
A “sweet disorder in the dress,” you
know; has been recommended by some
of our best poets.- And you plead for
respectability,. Here I take issue with
you.

Why be respectable? Even more,
why look so? Respectability is, I ad-
mit, a Virtue, but how unattractive.
Heaven forbid that we should - be
guided by the Seven Deadly Virtues,
of’ which Respectability leads all the

fmagination or courage ‘to be like

in those days what the college gir]

Fiji Islanders wearing? What are
the wearing in,Mesopotamia and the
Far Yukon?” And no one (well,

News of the New York Theatres
. Bernard Simon, who has been press
agent for various producers, is about
to flower on his own stem and bring
out a play by Leo Berenski called
Narrentanz, which has been adapted
by J. Mankiewicz, under the title, a
New Spanish Custom. The Ameri-
can theatre is no longer a dream,
but a reality. Ah!—Well, at least our
language comes in handy for the
titles.

_ Edward Choate is gaing to produce
the Jacques Natanson comedy, I Was

Waiting For You. Sounds: like the}

smoking room saga of the hall presi-
dent..

Peggy Wood abies in the Duke of

York’s Theatre in London recently in.
| Tonight Or Never, and cabled her

husband: “Smart: premiere, personal
triumph, press divided about play as
we expected.” It all goes to show

that self-effacement is not included |

in the personal policy of the star, and
that theatrical personalities are never
surprised at success. The only thing
that occasionally amazes them is the
public’s apparent inability to appre-
ciate manifest genius and charm.

Martin Flavin has written a new
opus, Amaco, which is an impression-
istic and episodic celebration of the
span of a machine’s life. -There-are
no women in the cast, and even a
feminist could understand the why
for. We doubt if even Greta Garbo
could accomplish much opposite a ma-
chine. The title is extremely expres-
sive—sounds like fourteen cents, in-
cluding tax, to us.

Gilbert Miller, producer of The
Late Christopher Bean and Firebird,
has a remarkable way of approach-
ing his new ventures. He hires the
stars, engages’a director, and a the-
atre, and then peers through the
scripts on his desk for a vehicle. At
present he plans to present Leslie
Howard and Helen Hayes in London
next spring and bring the production
to New York next fall if it proves
successful. Just what the production
will be is still being decided by Jupi-
ter and his pet urn.
a good opportunity for some _aspir-
ing members of the playwriting class
to sell their works of genius. Some
of the plays are especially adapted
to the aforementioned stars. Can
you think of anything more effective
than to have Helen Hayes, as a beau-
tiful queen, drive a.tent peg into Mr.
Howard’s head because he marred her
beauty with a branding iron? Tre-
mendous! Or again, Miss Hayes

would be supreme as the gangster’s |:

moll driving a wedge through Mr.
Howard’s (tough gang leader) tem-
ple withsa whisky bottle because he
“drilled” her boy friend! There seems
to be room in the theatre for us ear-
lier than we expected. 2

Again we find Representative Wil-
liam I. Sirovich popping up in the
theatre. You will recall that—he is
none other than the man who last

The account given in the December
7th number of the College News of
my talk at the College on November
380th contains several inaccuracies
which call for correction. In the first
place, the painting about which I
spoke was never called! by me “A
row of Buddhist. images,’’ but a roll.
It is painted not on silk, but on paper.
I presume the h instead of the k in
makimono is a typographical error.
I read a translation of the inscription
by the Emperor Ch’ien Lung which
says that the Imperial procession is
out of place at the beginning of, the
roll; I clearly stated, that I did not
agree with the illustrious critic. It
is putting it a little too strongly to
say that the “magnificence of the ‘roil
has in no way been destroyed by this ©
shamefwi mutilation.” What I said
is: “In spite Of all this mutilation,
however, the painting is still capable
of giving pleasure asa work of art.”
This statement also doubtless is re-
sponsible for the misquotation at the
close of the article. The country
which” produced. the groll -is..not the
Tai-lu Kingdom,.but the Ta Li King-
dom, and it is well known that ‘this

every man grimly bent to his task. A

In reply to some criticism made
of the last week’s College News, a
member of the editorial staff has in-
vited us to write a letter in which
we can voice our sentiments and give
constructive criticism. Moreover, a
happy statement in last week’s edi-
torial that “the medium for self-ex-
pression in the News is open to ev-
eryone” prompts us. '

First of all the copy editing: let
us look through the last edition. Dr.
Carpenter’s lecture, which was one
of the most outstanding events of the
year, and a real scholastic’ contribu-
tion to Bryn Mawr, was given a posi-
tion subordinate to Saks Fashion
Show, which is of doubtful interest
to the majority of the student body,
and of little importance. We feel
that this is aninsult to Dr, Carpenter
and to the standards of Bryn Mawr.
Greater care should have been. given
to the composing of this page. Dr.

-Carpenter’s lecture deserved a place

of honor on-the front page and a two-
column head. May we cite another
example of lack of proportion? In
the News of March 1, two front page
headings are given to athletics and
Dean Manning’s chapel talk on nu-
merical marks is placed on page. 3.
This is hardly: in line with the policy
which the News Board has advocat-
ed in the past, since several editorials
have been devoted to marks. We do
no wish to be too critical. We feel
that the News of November 9, 1932,
is an example of good taste in com-
position.

In regard to the editorial policy
of the News, we do not criticize the
subjects of your editorials, but the
bombastic manner in. whith they are
Furthermore, if you could
prove that your editorial criticisms

ee Seed

—~+——

-work like~a‘ slave for: it.



are as applicable to the majority of
your readers.as you state, we would
be delighted to uphold you. Unfor.
tunately we do not think that~ they
are, nor can we point with pride to
your “new -policy,” as stated in the
November 30, 1932, paper, that “im
mediately before every major vaca-
tion there will appear a devastating,

insulting and vitriolic editorial cal- |

culated to stir up enough commotion
in the world to make conversation
edsy for students during said: vaca-
tions.”

Not being on the Board ourselves
we claim no merits in style. But we
feel that anyone ‘who has passed the
Freshman English course should be
able to write comprehensibly. Just

what do you mean, in your editorfal--

of March 1st, by “But no one loves,
and no one woul be caught dead ab-
sorbing the theory of a celestial fund
of learning from which the favored
ones are equipped with a gamma ray
in the intellect that enables' them to
see through human superstitions.”

And perhaps Mr. King would teach

us how “to snort at a fetish.”

In concluding, may we also make
a -plea for greater accuracy and
thoughtful selection in your headings.
In the March 1 edition you speak of

Mrs. Sackville-West. As we all know, |

she is either Miss Sackvillé-West or
M#§. Harold Nicholson: : And we feel
that Miss Bruere in the review of
the Freshman Show deserves to be
headlined at least as much as Miss
Jones in the article about the Varsity
Players’ Club’s production of “The
Saint’s Day.”

Yours sincerely,

Eleanor R.- Eckstein, ’33;
Jane Parsons, ’34; Elizabeth Cham-
berlayne, ’35.



To the Editor of the College News:
It has been the feeling of a dis-
creetly murmuring minority that The
News has been on the path of inocu-
ous decadence for no little time, but
that now a point has been reached
where action seems imperative. This
action has consisted in pointing out
typographical errors, questioning
page placement and. editorial content,
and in every way possible entering
upon a campaign of destructive criti-
cism.
There is a certain dignity that The
News has expressed in its editorials,
which is rather flattering in view of
the fact that it is metaphorically
spoken of as “the mirror of campus
thought and opinion.” It is the bar-
renness of these sources that war-
rants the hanging of a little crepe;
the ‘willingness to belittle when it is

no secret that The News board will -

welcome with open arms and as one
of their number anyone showing the
slightest ability,

To the Editor of the College News:

I do not think there is any doubt
that the last Freshman Show was a
complete success from the viewpoint. |
of the audience; and, after- voicing
this opinion, most of us’ can say rio
more. I, however, have had an op-
portunity to observe the Show partly
from another angle—namely, its ef-
fect upon the freshman class—and iH.
is this phase which I believe to be
open to adverse criticism.

Most upperclassmen look back upon
their own Freshman Shows as the
greatest factor of that year in uni-
fying the class. For the first time
(and probably the last!) the entire
class worked as a whole, everyone
learned to know everyone else, every-
one was enthusiastic over a distinctly
class project, and everyone felt it a
privilege to belong to her class and
I doubt
very much if this prime purpose of
a Freshman Show has been fulfilled
this time. Happily for the delighted
audience, but unfortunately for. 1936,
its show was run almost entirely by
certain individuals in one or two
halls, who made no apparent effort

The object of. having the College

News under Undergrad., as I see it,
is first, to bring financial security
to the paper at the beginning of the
year, and ‘second, to have a college
project in’ which all the students co-
operate. This latter is, of course, a
good ideal. But compulsory co-opera-

be compulsory if the motion is pass-

in enough to establish security in the

Each individual’s fitness
To subscribe to the News or to not.

her
Several papers, including ~
The Ledger, the Times, and.the News,
To which this poems’ alluding.
If her throat’s not: irritated
At all by choice bits from the News,
Add the subscription expenses —
At once to her Undergrad dues. -
(2) Weigh her before and then after
Perusing the latest edition,
To find if she gains from the reading,
And determine per cent composi-
tion e
Of brain tissue; clean her with ether,
Dissolve her in H-N-O-three,
Precipitate out all the chlorides,
And solve her for Element E.

To the fourth decimal place.

ON. A GREAT EVIL
When a-walking she did go
The day was bright and cheery,
A new spring sky shone overhead
And everything was merry.
So forth she stepped, not closely
wrapped,

Her knitting.’neath her arm,
And plying both her needles bright
She wandered free from harm.
So on and on her thoughtless steps,
Till far from home she found

That cruelly, slowly, fatally,
The rain was falling down.
Alas, alack, the maiden’s back
Protection lacked quite clearly,
Her knitting new of brightest blue
Was running rather queerly.
Then home she sped and into bed,
Her teeth too shaken for talking.
Moral: If you would wiser be,
You’d best not knit while walking.

Movie Review.
Katherine Hepburn returns in. a

new picture, Christopher Strong. The _

vehicle is inferior to her last one,
Bill of Divorcement; in fact, Christ-
opher Strong, as a movie, may be dis-
missed in a very few words. It is a
poor story, in which are collected a
number of worn motives. Lady Cyn-
thia Darrington (Katherine Hep-
burn) is introduced as a beautiful
girl pf over twenty-one, who has

never had a love-affair, and Christ-.

opher Strong (Colin: Clive) as 4 man
who has been married for over five
years and is still in love with his
wife. .-The rest of the story is con-
cerned with their undoing. They fall
in love; Mrs. Christopher Strong dis-
covers it and suffers in silence. In
the meantime their daughter has a
stormy affair .with a married man,
and when he has finally obtained a
divorce, marries: him, against her
mother’s protestations. Lady Cyn-
thia, a famous flier, flies around the
world to win a speed record, and
spends some time in New York with
Christopher. On discovering that she
is going to have a child, her doctor
forbids her to fly any more. She,
however, realizing how despegately
this will involve the man she loves,

leaving the Strong family to live
united and in peace. The one fact
worthy of notice is the unconvention.
al good: sense of Mrs. Strong, who
says nothing and allows matters to
straighten themselves out.

Yet if there were no story at all,
Christopher Strong would still. be
more than worth going to see for the
performance of Katherine Hepburn.
Miss Hepburn is an actress, who not
merely tries to allure people by perox-
ide hair and false eyelashes, but is
conscious of the artistic requirements
of a stage and of the business of act-
ing. Personally, we think Miss Hep-
burn has all the high-cheekboned
beauty of Greta’ Garbo, besides the
latter’s ability: to wear masculine
clothes, and at the same time is bet-
ter looking, and can speak English.
Besides her personal attraction, she
is, We repeat, among our very best
actiesses today. She dominates a
fairly poor and otherwise uninterest-
ing picture, and makes her part of
it into a work of art which we ad-

vise everyone to see, if only to watch

Katherine- Hepburn wear trousers
and a polo-shirt, or, again, trailing
black. velvet; and, to hear her talk-
ing with mechanics,-and then reason-
ing in her sane way with Christopher.

Dear Editor:

If we must -have required courses,
let us discriminate and not place Dic-
tion, Hygiene, and Body Mechanics
before the Bible. The Bible is, of
course, a cornerstone of our culture.
Therefore we cannot fully understand
or interpret our literature until we
know the Bible well. Until we have
studied it; we have omitted a. large
part of the world’s greatest litera-
ture and have no right to be critics.
We should have the Bible always in
our minds as a criterion of excellence
by which to estimate other literature.
A careful study of the Bible is in-
spiring not only to the mature liter-
ary student, but also to all types, to a
young mind that understands through
narrative; as well as to’ a mature
philosopher. The. Bible is not to be
read superficially and easily, yet how
many of us have only a superficial
knowledge of it. We are denying our-
selves a great experience by pretend-
ing that we have had it. ‘With a re-
quired course, at least we should all
be exposed to this experience.

After reading your recent editorial
the ~° Reserve
Room,” it seems evident that the writ-

»f is ignorant of the rules governing

the reserved books. ' Exceptions to the
posted rules are always made when
good reasons are presented.

In the first place, the student, who
is leaving for the week-end and who
wants to take a book, is, allowed to
take it at 9.30 on Friday evening, pro-
vided there are other copies of the
book available, that the class is small,
and that she can assure the librarian
that such an act does not interfere
with the work of the other students.
~ Secondly, as for the “studious spir-
it” who reads “unwanted supplement-
ary books,” it has been the practice
for the librarian to take said book
from the reserve and to allow the

_ “studious spirit” to take the book in

her own name and thus to remove the
danger of “mould” gathering on the
“incomprehensible” volume.

The third point is well taken. It
has semed to the librarian entirely
unnecessary to have a reserve at all
for the small class. It would seem far
better to allow the “scholar” who “in-
volves herself in a small class of a
higher and deeper nature” to be per-

'+ mitted to take the needed books from

the Stacks in her own name and thus
not be hampered by the two hour time
limit,
for books in more popular demand.
This, however, is a matter for the in-
dividual professor to decide.

As far as the fourth point is con-
cerned, the librarian will not attempt
to judge of the relative “conducive”
merits of the “interior decoration” of
the smoking-room and of the library
reading room as places _for serious
work. Experience has proven that it

. is not wise to allow reserve books gen-

erally to be taken from the building
during the day. However, students
have always been allowed to take. re-
serve books to any part-of the library
building, including the Cloisters, pro-
vided they indicate their location on
the reserve slip. Also, books may be
taken toa student’s room_or to the
Infirmary in case of illness.

Your writer probably does not_real-
ize that each hall is provided with
a library which contains duplicates of
many of the books which are always
put on the reserve. The books may be
used in private rooms or smoking-
rooms when a proper charge has been
left for them.

We agree with the writer that we
shall always have the lawless and the
careless with us. Their actions work
a hardship; not on the librarians, but
on their own classmates. It is. be-
cause of them that rules are neces-
sary.

Finally, it has_been the policy of
this college library to have as few
rules as possible and to permit only
such rules as have for their objective
the greatest good for the greatest
number.

Sincerely yours, 2

The outside world made the conditions
that made the Third Reich possible,
and we may not, therefore, talk too

~-glibly of German guilt, for we are ac-

the government, but there is no doubt

that internal péace and outward unity”

are an estaMlished fact. Whether
this peace and unity have been bought
at too high a price remains to be-seen.

National Socialism is imbued with
idealism and a spirit of self-sacrifice.
“Common good comes before individ-
ual good,” or “Genera] welfare before
private gain” is a common maxim, The
people, especially the young people,
have enthusiasm, devotion, faith in the
future and in a new and better state
of German blood on German soil. Nazi-
ism is essentially a Youth Movement,
and the young people have responded
to Hitler’s call. The spirit of self-
sacrifice may be found in all classes,
as was demonstrated in the relief
movement last winter, when seven mil-
lion needy Germans were given assist-
ance. ""Too much stress has been laid
in the papers on the barbarous side of
Naziism, for the National Socialist
People’s Welfare Organization can-
not be disregarded. Hitler is now
launching a campaign for the coming
winter against hunger and cold in the
face of even greater difficulties than
existed last year.

Unemployment has decreased from

six million in January, 1933, to two}

million, four hundred thousand in Au-
gust, 1934. Part of the decrease was
due to a natural revival of internal
trade, but mainly to the public works
program. Old roads and houses are
being repaired, new roads and houses
are being built. There is a Voluntary
Labor Service, corresponding to our
Civilian Conservation Corps, whicli
does reforestation and road-building.
The Labor Service is voluntary for the
rank. and file between the ages of 17
and 25, but is compulsory for Uni-
versity students. It does not train for
war, as is commonly believed, but does
train the young people in the prin-
ciples of Naziism, and it attempts
to raise the standard of physique. All
the unmarried young people have been
discharged from their ‘positions. in
business and industry, and put to
work in the Labor Service. Their po-
sitions are filled by married older peo-
ple, and pressure has been put on the
employers to hire more workers and
to discharge no one, ‘In the case of
a husband and wife both being em-
ployed, the woman is discharged, and
in order to encourage marriages, State
loans are made to newly-married cou-
ples. Twenty-five per cent. of the
loan is cancelled for each child born.
The tax on automobiles has been abol-
ished, and other taxes have been re-
duced. Part of the net profits of any
business are exempted from taxation
if it is used to replace the plants and
machinery.

Two criticisms may be made of the
employment statistics, First, they are
not computed on a pre-Hitler basis,
because the 930,000 people in the Re-
lief works are listed as employed, al-
though they receive only 25 pfennigs
a day. The Jews and Pacifists who
lost their jobs in the Revolution are
not listed as unemployed if they have
pensions or incomes. Furthermore,
the total volume of wages has not in-
creased, and the wage level has in-
creased only slightly, while prices have

risen through inflation, so that real

wages are generally lower than before
the Revolution.

A more important criticisni may be
raised that the unemployment decrease
may not be permanent. The recovery
program has been largely financed on
credit, dependent on an industrial ré-
vival, but an‘industrial revival is‘im-
possible in a country whose domestic
prices are rising, whose raw mate-
rials are imported, and which is fac-
ed with the problem of tariffs and
Jewish boycotts. The’floating debt is
becoming unmanageable, and a col-
lapse has been predicted in the next
three months, but a collapse is impos-
sible unless Hitler is assassinated.
Germany an live as a self-contained
economic unit, but it must be on a
lower standard of living. The public

ermanently, but not at its present
extent,

Since there are certain misunder-
standings about the Loan Book ‘Rules
we submit them below.* The argu-
ment has been advanced that there
have been changes in the regulations
and that the students have not been
sufficiently advised.

There have been no changes in the
past fifteen years except to strike off
rule after rule as they were found
There
is, however, this difference in the situ-
ation;- that there have simply been
more infringements this year and of
such a nature that the work of the
whole student body has been affect-
ed. When a single copy of a book,
in which assignments have been made
to a class, is taken surreptitiously to
a student’s room and kept for weeks,
something must be done to discipline
the student who took it. In the case
of less violent infractions of the rule,
we find “students. who receive notices
for the return of books and simply
drop them into their waste-baskets
and thus make the Loan Desk Li-
brarian spend valuable time writing
second notices. :

We have tried to devise penalties
which would be effective and still per-
mit the students to keep the books in
question. We are very much against
the idea of money fines. The sins of
children, in these times of financial
depression, should not be visited on
Of course, in the opin-
ion of the busy Loan Desk Librarian,
slow torture would be just retribution.
Since such a punishment is a bit; out
of date and might seriously deplete
the numbers of the student body, we
have compromised on the present rule.
It seems to be the best solution of
a troublesome problem.

We might add for the benefit of
those who object that there are no
printed rules, that five years ago the
Reference Librarian wrote a Library
Handbook and Reference Guide, but
lack of college funds prevented its
publication. However, the rules are
fully explained orally to the entering
classes every year and that ought to
be sufficient.

I was really distressed to learn from
Mrs. Skinner’s day letter as printed
in the College News of February 27
that my remarks in Chapel on Febru-
ary 14 had had such a different effect
on those interested in May Day out-
side the College than the one intended
or the one produced, I think, on the un-
dergraduate audience.

In the first place, Mrs. Skinner en-
tirely misunderstood my comments on
the 19832 May Day in supposing that
I was criticizing the performance. No
one who saw the performance could
possibly have wished for anything bet-
ter, and it is because of the perfection
of the later May Day performances
that ‘those of us who have seen them
are unwilling either to think of May
Day being abandoned or to look for-
ward-to its being given any less well

than it has been in recent years. Most |.

of us believe that one or two of the
plays could be omitted without any
real detriment to the performance as a
whole, but it is clear that unless the
pageant and the dancing are up to the
standard of 1932 alumnae and stu-
dents alike will be deeply disappointed.

The difficulties in 1932, as all who
were members of the college commun-
ity at that time will remember, were
entirely connected with interruptions
to the regular work of the semester

say that the couples are irretrievably
scrambled by the final curtain.

The situation has its elements of
humor, but it seems to us rather bed-
room, and the bedroom has long ago
seen its best days. The dialogue is
excellent in spots, but the plot is too

las’s undoubted wit. Shandra Mac-
Pherson plays the leading sophisticate
with ‘considerable charm and: ability,
and she looks very attractive in the
deshabile ‘that characterizes the play,
but we fear that her talents are wast-
ed in an inferior vehicle. Walter Hal-
liday, one of the fadists, is also good,
and has the rare talent of getting at-
tractively drunk on the stage. The
subsidiary members of both groups
are adequate, especially Horatio
Loomis, one of the best ingenues of
the season. Our opinion is that if you
are presented with a pair of tickets,
you might as well go, for it is good
for several laughs, bytdon’t spend
your last cent on it.

In an editorial in the March 13 is:
sue of the College News there are sev-
eral points to which I should like to
call attention. The writer of the edi-
torial says, “Bryn Mawr officially is
not allowed to make a pilgrimage ‘to
Vassar or Smith for the purpose -of
competition in basketball, hockey, ten-
nis, and other sports. If we go at all,
each individual girl takes upon herself
the responsibility of transporting her-
self thither and back, and the Bryn
Mawr Varsity team is actually -not
present in name, even though it lgoms

large as life in person. It-is doubt-

less true that this pronibition against ‘

engaging in organized activities is a
hindrance to us in arranging #ched-
ules with the other colleges.”

There are several misstatements in
the above sentences. Every other year
the Bryn Mawr varsity tennis team
goes—as the Bryn Mawr Varsity ten-
nis team—to Vassar, where a number
of matches are played with the Vassar
team. In alternate years the Vassar
team comes to Bryn Mawr. The en-
tire expense of each trip is shared by
the Athletic Associations of the two
colleges. In the same way, one ‘year
the Bryn Mawr varsity swimming
team goes to Swarthmore, and the
next year the Swarthmore team comes
here, the two Athletic Associations
sharing all expenses. In each of the
above cases the Bryn Mawr team is
officially present at the other college
as a Bryn Mawr varsity team.

The Athletic Association is in ac-
cord with the Administration and the
Physical Education Department - in
having no special desire at present for
further extension of our athletic rela-
tions with other colleges. We feel that.
the emphasis on varsity teams, with
their few members, should be no
greater than the emphasis on the
m@ch lar ger group of players who are
not on varsities.

The problem of time is necessarily
very important. For four or five girls
to go to Vassar every other year for
the tennis trip requires a great deal of
manoeuvering and planning. It would
be almost impossible to arrange such
a trip for a whole hockey team with-
out seriously affecting our full sched-
ules and academic work.

Another point is that such “pilgrim-
ages” as those suggested in the News
are quite- expensive, and since each
undergraduate contributes the same
amount of money to the Athletic As-
sociation, we feel that this money
should be spent as far as possible for
the bert of the ‘whole student body
rather than for a chosen few.

We do not want our varsity sports
activities to become a_ standardized
business of intercollegiate competition.
Several of the men’s colleges, which
have been embroiled in such a system
are now placing increasing emphasis
on smaller, more numerous, perhaps
less expert teams, on which are repre-
sented the greatest-possible number of
students. In a similar way we feel
that class teams are just as important
and deserving of support as are varsi-
ties.

The Athletic Association, therefore,
does not at present feel any special
need for furthering geographically
our sports activities. But such exten-
sion is perfectly possible, as is evi-
denced by the two already existing
cases; and as further need, desire,"

The efforts of most human beings
are consumed in the struggie for their
daily bread, but most of those who are,
either through fortune or some special
gift, relieved of this struggle ‘are
largely absorbed in further improving
their worldly lot. Beneath the effort
directed toward the accumulation of
worldly goods lies all too frequently
the illusion that this is the most sub-

achieved; but there is, fortunately, a
minority composed of those who rec-
ognize early in their lives that the
most beautiful and satisfying experi-
ences open to humankind are not de-
rived from the outside, but are bound
up with the development of the indi-
vidual’s own feeling, thinking and act-
ing. The genuine artists, investigat-
ors and thinkers have always been
persons of this kind. However incon-
spicuously the life of these individuals
runs its course, none the less the fruits
of their endeavors are the most valu-

In view of the great importance
in the present days of the foreign
policy of our Government with refer-
ence to the conflict between Italy
and Ethiopia and the League’s ac-
tions to curb that conflict, it may be
brought to the notice of the student
body that Mr. Roosevelt’s policy is
one of isolation, and an entire re-
versal of the previous neutrality
policy of the United States in other
wars.

Neutrality, historically and legally,
means the right to trade with bel-
ligerents in certain fixed cases. Be-
cause this concept means very di-
rect connections with the nations at
war, it results in involving the neu-
tral in the war in all too many
cases. It has been the experience of
the United States that neutrality has
not been a peaceful policy, because
it is the obligation of. the neutral
to uphold neutral rights, and with
the changing conditions that are an
inevitable part of every war,. neu-
trality rights have been violated.

Isolation, on the other hand, is
staying away from the belligerents,
and not permitting trade of our na-
tionals with them. That step has
been taken only in the case of arms,
ammunition and materials of war;
but it has been hinted at and re-
quested in the pronouncements of
the State Department in the last
few weeks.

Apart from all considerations of
world security and the prevention of
future wars, isolation would seem to
be the policy best suited to keep us

from being involved. in wars.

Dear Editors: — ge
I was glad to see the News’ last

that the-quality of teaching at Bryn
Mawr may continue “of the same
sharp tenor,” and that our faculty
may not lose the fine scholars and the
“inspiring guidance into the most en-
grossing and difficult aspects of every
subject” which Bryn Maw7 Students
demand. -I -felt, however,. that the
writer dealt too ambiguously with the
departure of . “exceptional teachers,”
and hid the real point of her article
in an unobtrusive mention of those
who “have. left before retirement
although not wishing it'so.” Am I
right in supposing her true complaint
to be that of the refrain. of the cur-
rent Bryn Mawr student song (tune,
My Bonnie Lies Over the Ocean),

opinion most heartily. I feel that the
real anxiety. which members of both

A FELLOW STUDENT.

Editor’s Note: No, Fellow Student,
the editorial which appeared two
weeks ago in the News was not in-
spired by the specific aspect of the
teaching situation which you imply
nor by any particular example of this
situation recently experienced. Neither
have personal feelings of exuberance
or animosity however general among
the readers of News found expres-
sion in its editorial columns. That
editorial was a reflection of the opin-
ion of a large body of the undergradu-
ates who have remarked in their own
and their immediate _predecessors*:.ex-
perience at college a trend away from
the quality of teaching which made
this year’s celebration a genuine cause
for pride.

There was no attack intended, ex-
cept against our own past failure to
make clear what we want in college.
If the students remain stonily silent,
no one in the world can hope to give
them what they want, although when
once their desires are expressed; no
one would oppose them if they
are for their own and the college’s
genuine welfare. The News exists
just for this very purpose—to give
genuine student opinion an oppor-
tunity to be heard accurately and
without the fallacies of rumors.

When undergraduates do have an
opinion or an expression of what they
hope Bryn Mawr to be they should
express it clearly. That editorial was
merely a too-seldom-seen statement
from many students of their view of
what they realize but one aspect of
one of the many problems which Bryn
Mawr must face if she is to continue
to be an outstanding college.

I wish to register a protest to the
editors of the College News. It is
with hesitation, but with a sense of
righteous indignation that I do it. In
the one great crisis, in the one great
event of the year, the News failed!

I shall explain. At 8 o’clock Mons
day evening, October 12, the largest



‘parade that was ever seen in Bryn

Mawr marched up the pike. Never

before in its annals had such a large

of Bryn Mawr. The oldest. citizens
of the village could remémber noth-
ing to compare with it, even in the

to mark the great national holidays
of the country.

Among the spectacular exhibits of
the evening were the fire trucks of all
the surrounding villages: West
Manayunk, Merion—it is difficult to
name them all—and finally the trium-
phant trucks of the Bryn Mawr vol-
unteers, once known as the “million-
aire fire department.”

The Wilson Laundry (advt.) pa-
raded ten trucks; the wreckers and
garages. had poor battered cars. in
tow. The Bryn Mawr News Agency
boasted two bright yellow numbers in
its fleet. Wallaces, Gane and Sny-
der, Meth’s, the Penn Beef Company,
the A. & P., Bond Bread, the RCA
Amplifying Company, Ballantine’s, the
Wood Beverage Company and Stock-
ton’s were among the rooters for Bet-
ter Business in Bryn Mawr.

A band of the Choctaw Tribe went
whooping by, striking terror to the
mob that stood three and four deep
along the mighty new concourse, the
awful light of their red torches fall-
ing in ghastly shadows on their war
paint. In. striking contrast was Ex-
hibit A of the B. P. O. E., which de-
picted a shivering little girl in white
nightie and pumps praying at the side
of her pallet, with waving palms oc-
cupying the rear of the truck and the
protecting elk’s head nodding graci-
ously at the front.

Musical interludes were furnished
by a group of Hawaiian-Eskimo play-
ers, over four bands, the RCA record-
ing truck and the fire sirens and bells
of the valiant Volunteers.

The parade was brought up by a
number of individualists and a sound
truck that opined, “Next time you
will have Knox as Vice-President,
Landon as your President!”

The evening was just the beginning
of a week of celebration for Bryn
Mawr., One of the indications of this
was the distribution (sub rosa, pretty
much) of little slips of paper. These,
when duly filled out with name and
address, were supposed to net the
owner a prize at the meeting of the
Better Business Bureau that will peak
the activities next Friday night. Un-
fortunately, however, these were sup-
posed to be dropped into boxes, except
letter boxes and the night deposit box.

Book Review

Judson P. Philips and Robert W.
Wood, Jr., authors of Hold ’Em, Girls,
the Intelligent Woman’s Guide to Men
and Football (Putnam, $1.75), have
set. out to write a book which will
“keep dumb females from spoiling.a
football game with dumber questions.”
In clear and concise fashion they ex-
plain. the fundamentals of the game,
discuss individual plays and illustrate
their descriptions with well-labeled
and easily understandable diagrams,
all of which should be of great value
in the education of the feminine foot-
ball public. The wide-eyed, shrieking
lass has no longer any excuse to call
football players “cute” or to cheer
vociferously when her escort’s pet
team fails to score.

vclassified the three usual types of men,
who take women to football games,
and have given full instructions as to
their care and feeding. When and
how much to drink, what to wear and
when to display an interest in collegi-
ate cheering sections, are also com-
rpetently explained in an attractive
and humorous style. There is even a
chapter on the etiquette of listening
to games over the radio. We can no

Bryn Mawr Gallantly

Falls Before Beaver



Successful Season Prophesied
Despite Final Score of 3-2;
Line Confused



FINAL HALF DEFENSIVE



October 16:—Inauspicious weather
and a rather poor supporting gallery
watched Bryn Mawr fall gallantly be-
' fore Beaver’s onslaught in a hockey
game which, in spite of the final score,

gave promise of future successes for
Varsity. During the first half Bryn
Mawr kept the ball down near the
opponent’s circle, but failed to take
advantage of this situation as well
as they might have if tere had been
less confusion and moré quick pass-
ing within the goal territory.

In mid-field the forward line func-
tioned smoothly with confidence and
speed, using short lateral passes to
evade the Beaver backfield. The longer
passes from the backs to the forwards
were ineffectual because they were
usually directed right toward the
sticks of the opponents. /

On the whole, however, Bryn Mawr
seemed to have an upper hand in the
first period. They had more confi-

dence than the visitors, and ran with

greater speed. The fullbacks espe-
cially attacked their adversaries with
precision and swiftness; and the for-
wards rallied in the middle of the
half to rush down to the goal where"

order to obtain a fair view of the whole question, the forum should in-
elude the sentiments of undergraduates, graduates and especially of
the faculty, rarely voiced an opinion on this recurrent
-problem.

A forum would remove the confusion of innumerable theories and
outline some of sthe vague solutions which are prevalent on the campus.
This indistingthess and variation can be noted in the following opinions.
Several styfdents regard the orals as no problem at all and feel that ten
years faim now anyone who has once passed her orals has, with the
aid” ‘of a dictionary, an indelible knowledge of French and German.
Some violently stand for the total obliteration of orals. Others praise
the requirement of a reading knowledge of French and German, but

It was with great interest that I
read your editorial of last week re-
garding the lighting system of the
college. . Certainly you are bringing
up the question which most needs im-
mediate solution. It is, I am con-
vinced, the one point on which the
student body will agree; it would not
only be more comfortable to have more
and better lighting, we absolutely need
it. This not only applies to the stu-
dents’ rooms and Taylor, ‘but also to
the smoking rooms in the halls, and
éSpecially the laboratories in Dalton.

We could probably get on very well
without new science apparatus or new
wings in the library—we could prob-
ably get oh without. the variety of
courses and the proportionately large
number. of professors which Bryn
Mawr offers at present—but the ques-
tion of the proper enjoyment of ap-
paratus, buildings and courses rests
with the lighting system perhaps more
than any other factor.

Right now many students are using
sixty or seventy watt bulbs in open
defiance of college regulations. They
cannot be excused for this, but cer-
tainly it should not’ be necessary for
them to do so.

I reflect the sentiments of the stu-
dents, I am sure, when I compliment.
you’on the stand you have taken, and
I hope that there will be some response
to your plea in the near future. Yours

Admiring the promptitude and pre-

cision with which the News presents

the important problems of the student

‘body, I wish to thank the Board for

taking up the issue of the lighting
system. Being obliged myself to wear
glasses a large part of the time, it
is with vigor that I protest against
the inadequacy of the present arrange-
ments.. The lack is, of course, pri-
marily felt in the students’ rooms, and
for those who study almost exclusively
there, this is a very serious defect.
However, not only the electrical ar-
rangements in the halls, but also those
in Dalton are markedly inefficient.
For the majors, whose lab periods last
until 6 o’clock, the lighting system
is a definite handicap, in actual visi-
bility as well as in such experiments
as entail electrical effects. For the
faculty and graduate students who
are in Dalton late in the evening these
conditions must be very trying.

I make this appeal with the realiza-
tion that the readjustment of the pres-
ent system, or the preferable alterna-
tive of installing alternating current
instead of the present direct current,
necessitates large expense. As the
college may not be in a position to
appropriate such a sum at present,
a gift for such a purpose from an
alumna, or friend of the college, who
does not wish to contribute to a gen-
eral fund, or feels no interest in the
new science building, would be an
ideal solution. Surely there is no
safer investment than the preserva-
tion of the students’ eyesight, which
is at present under definite strain due
to the insufficiency of proper light.
Whether the college feels it can bear
the expense of such readjustment as
is obviously necessary, or whether a
kind friend or alumna undertakes to
bestow on us a gift, whose beneficial
effect would extend over the entire
campus, a remedy for the. present.
system must be found, and found
promptly. 2 SENIOR.

the sort of men we entertain while at college. They are “first group
men who come here for an intellectual soirée or a taffy pull.” Nothing
could really be more heartily complimentary than having the public
realize that we entertain the brainy, athletic type. The fifth point is
perhaps the most generous of all. It is the author’s admonition to his
compatriots that they must use their very own judgment in selecting
from among us. This presupposes a slight perplexity which can easily
be dispelled. If it is a choice between brains and taffy, the two can be
pleasantly merged.

As a German major I should like
to present my views on the present.
oral system. While agreeing with
Miss Kimberly and Miss King that
the emotional effects of the orals is
undoubtedly bad, I cannot agree with
their criticism of thé courses, nor can
I approve of their suggested reme-
dies.

Miss Kimberley suggests\that st
dents who offer German for entynce
credit be allowed to take a litertaure
course which should be given as & sub-
stitute for the present elementary
reading course, ,as the two courses
now offered are either too elementary
or too advanced. The majority of

students who enter with three years
of high school German are well pre-

pared to take the First Year Litera-|

ture course and are able to pass the
oral with no difficulty. For those
students who had less than three years
of school German, the elementary
reading course provides the oppor-
tunity to acquire a real “reading
knowledge” of the language. I be-
lieve it would be impossible to give a
course “concentrating more on rapid
reading ability and less on details of
Unless one knows the de-
tails of structure thoroughly, one can
never acquire a rapid reading ability,
for the ability to read German de-
pends ‘on the reader’s immediate recog-
nition of the kind of word and its
part in the structure of the sentence.

The elementary reading course gives ;

the student practice in the necessary
study of the German sentence and at
the same time enlarges her vocabulary
so that she acquires a reading knowl-
edge of the language.

Secondly, I do not feel that the
remedy offered for those who take
Baby German is practical or possible.
By the end of elementary German if
a student is not able to pass the oral
she is not equipped with a reading
knowledge of German, in which case
the reading course is absolutely es-
sential. The student who cannot pass
the oral is not equipped to take any
sort of a literature course, but needs
more drill on sentence structure.

I do not deny that the present oral
system presents many difficulties, but
I doubt if the problem can be solved
as easily as Miss Kimberley and Miss
King would have us think, Both stu-
dents agree that the purpose of the
orals is good, but they desire a change
in method of preparation for the ex-
aminations. Can this be accomplished
without a radical change in the cur-
ricula of the college? I am inclined
to think that the present system with
a few minor changes is the most sat-
isfactory one which can be obtained.
It is generally agreed that the Ger-
man oral is the worst stumbling block,
and not the French: this would seem
to prove that time is the essential
requisite to a lasting knowledge of a
language, since most of us study
French throughout our school years.
Can one, therefore, improve upon the
present method of teaching German
to college students unless one requires
at entrance a certain amount of study
in the language?

My suggestions for improving the
present system are as follows: First
to give all students credit for the ele-
mentary reading course, so that they
will feel able to spend the necessary
time for preparation. Second, to al-
low students to be in the advanced

with the rules for leaving the campus

Nearly all of us would like to work

the majority of the Executive and Ad-

be done right now. The student body
as a whole is too ignorant of what
the rules actually are. They depend
entirely upon those who give special
permission and do not take enough
responsibility upon themselves.

I d@mot think that the students are
entirely to blame for this. They have
been confused by the vagueness of the
rules and the failure of those of us

the purpose of these rules, which are

The- requirement ofa reading
knowledge of French and German is
dictated -by the Faculty of Bryn Mawr
College, and the “merits and weak-
nesses of such a requiremnt are~not
a matter for the German Department
to defend. Your invitation to express
ourselves, however, we gladly accept.
. Our duty, as we see it, is to help
students with this requirement. We
find it an arduous task; but we think
we are making fairly good progress.
‘I well remember that in the year when
I came to Bryn Mawr, over fifty stu-
dents out of eighty who took the ex-
amination in May failed. I remem-
ber it because it was a- severe blow
to my pride as a teacher, for I was
the unfortunate who had been trying
to teach students a reading knowledge
of German, and there was never a
failing .student...who- was -more—de-
pressed’ than I was that spring. To
be sure, it was teaching under ‘dif-
ficulties, for the course was a so-called
“rapid-reading” course, in which great
quantities of fiction were assigned and
conferences held once a fortnight on
this reading. It was very thoroughly
extra-curricular: not only did the stu-
dents receive no credit for it, but they
had received no credit for the three-
hour elementary course that had pre-
ceded it, and their attendance in either
was purely voluntary.

Compared with those days, our pres-
ent “extra-curricular reading _ course
seems to be doing a fairly good job;
certainly not more than ten per cent
of the students who took if in the last
two years have failed. In addition to
that, during the last two years, some-
what more than thirty per cent of our
students have succeeded in passing the
examination after only one year of
elementary German (for which the
Faculty has~conceded one unit of
credit), and we expect to improve on
this record in the future, for we have
not ceased working on the problem.
There has been no weakening in the
standard of the examination, rather
the opposite. I have been the constant
member on the German Committee for
ten years and I have noted the ten-
dency to tighten up as the students
improve.

Now as to the question of “lasting
knowledge” in language work: such a
thing does not exist. And I am glad
of this opportunity to repeat here
what I never fail to bring to the at-
tention of my students: Neglect your



vanish away from you. The entire
investment of time and energy is lost
to the student who does not form the
habit of reading in the foreign lan-
guage. And the method of acquisition
—whether by a course or by cramming
(and our elementary course is cram-
ming), makes vary little difference in
this sad truth. I have seen immi-
grants forgetting even their mother
tongue in less than a decade where
there was not opportunity to use it.
You cannot put your language pro-
ficiency\in storage. It must be used,
or it will be gone in a short time, and
that is why the Faculty rules that
students shall show such—proficiency
at the time when they are about to
begin their advanced work, in which
they are éxpected to use their foreign
languages, namely, in their. junior
year.

As to-substituting the requirement
of a course in German literature for
the examination, that would not: only
put considerable restrictions on the
student who, under the present plan,
is atleast free to get her reading
knowledge wherever and in whatever
way she pleases, but it would, on the
other hand, not answer the purpose of
the Faculty ‘as well, as may be seen
from the fact that even students who
have passed First Year German and
sometimes also Second Year German

Dear Madam,

We were devastated to read in the

March 17 College News that the
D’Oyly Carte stage sets are to be
copied for the Glee Club production
of The Mikado. We must now write
that “letter to the News” that never
got written during. our undergradu-
ate days!
, Looking back on. ihe: stage sets de-
signed and built by undergraduates
for the various Goodhart productions,
it seems a pity to set such a precedent.
How much creative genius was put
into the many sets that graced Good-
hart in our not tod distant day—and
how much fun at least for the de-
signers,—-even when actual genius
was lacking! Will the French Club
now proceed to copy the sets of the
Comedie Francaise? And _ will the
Dramatic Club see fit to ¢opy—or
rent!—a Broadway stage set if it
happens that their play had also been
having a New York run? Is the day
gone when two days before a perform-
ance the amateur genius in charge of
sets decides thaf¥rose is all wrong for
that boudoir, and the whole must be
repainted in a pale blue?

We also have ,unbounded admira-
tion for the brilliant sets of the
D’Oyly Carte Company, but feel that
college is college, over all too soon,
and that the opportunity for experi-
menting and creating should not thus
be destroyed.

Sincerely, -

The Bryn Mawr Glee Club has al-
ways felt very keenly the importance
of maintaining, in every. Gilbert and
Sullivan performance, the tradition
which makes for the success of these
operettas. It is well known to every
one who is at all familiar with Gil-
bert and Sullivan that this tradition
has been preserved in every detail by
the D’Oyle Carte Company. It would
therefore seem evident that to ensure
a good performance it is better to fol-
low the acknowledged best than to
substitute a poor original.

The Glee Club has always taken the
D’Oyle Carte for its model and hav-
ing its sets similar to theirs is hardly
setting a precedent. The students
themselves feel that their “creative
genius” is put to far greater ad-
vantage in producing scenery which
is up to the standard of the rest of
the performance, than merely for the

ake of originality—to break a tra-
dition which has been a policy of the
Glee Club since it was founded.

To the Editor of The College News:
In the last few issues’the News has
devoted a considerable amount of
space to the combined activities of
Mr. Wyckoff’s stagecraft course and
the Players Club. It has given
these - two organizations encourage-
ment which has been much appreci-

ated. For this reason, as well as for
the sake of general college interest, I
feel it necéssary to make’ public: cer-
tain difficulties which make it impos-
sible to carry out the program of one-
act plays this. spring as originally in-
tended. The members of Mr. Wyckoff’s
class, including the Players Club, find
that through lack of time and inade-
quate facilities they are forced to
choose between plans of action. Either
$hey ‘must discontinue the stagecraft
class and put through the program of
plays, or, continuing the stagecraft
class, they must abandon the actual
production of the plays. If the first
plan were followed, the whole pur-
pose and value of Mr. Wyckoff’s

performance would be no different
from the usual products of our un-
trained abilities. In addition to this,
some of those most interested in stage-
craft would be unable to help with
the production. The plays, therefore,
would be: produ¢ed without the help
of those whose aid is most needed.
,Not only would the .contributions of
these people be lost, but they them-
selves in ‘not having the stagecraft
course, would lose an opportunity to
gain knowledge which would benefit
enormously any future efforts of the
Players Club.

The second plan, then, has been de-
cided upon as being the most prac-
ticable and most beneficial under the
circumstances. The Players Club will
give The Open Door, Trifles and Pas-
sion, Poison and Petrefaction in Oc-
tober of next semester instead of i
May of this semester. The interven-



course would be lost and the resultant/



Committee Disciisses New. Blaice

In reference to the proposed Social
Economy-major for undergraduates,
the Curriculum Committee has made
a poll of those seniors and juniors who
would have majored in the course if
it had beenavailable-to them and
those freshmen=and~sophomores who
desire to take up such a major. Any

|one who would like to find out more

about the course should speak to some
member of the Curriculum Committee.



for these plays, both practically and -
in regard to theory, under the direc-.
tion of Mr. Wyckoff.

It is quite apparent, however, that
the choice between these two plans
would have been unnecessary if, Mr.
Wyckoff and the Players Club had
had a proper place in which to work.
The progress of Mr. Wyckoff’s class
has been greatly hindered by cramped
conditions on Goodhart stage. If
adequate facilities had been provided,
theélass would now be sufficiently ad-
vanced in the course to undertake im-
mediate production. And this, I be-
lieve, would have not made any great
additional demands on the time and
energy of those inYolved. .I feel that
no. real and memorable ‘dramatic
achievements (sith the exception of
Big: May Day),.experimental or other-
wise, will be made at Bryn Mawr until

is at the disposal of the students.

This letter is written in the hope of
bringing before the whole: college—
students and faculty—the serious need
which the seniors feel for a week’s
reading period prior to the final ex-
We find to-
day. an enormous amount of work to
be done and inadequate time in which
to do it. Under the present schedule,

‘classes continue until Friday, May

14, and examinations: begin on Mon-
Classes have always
cofitinued until the Friday before
Monday examinations, but the seniors
feel that the new finals necessitate /a
longer preparation period. Although
we realize that this review should
have -been spaced through the’ whole
year and that the system igs still in
the experimental stage, we’ feel that
a week will always be necessary for
the, intergration of so much material.

We are very grateful to those de-
partments which have. carefully pre-
pared their students for the examina-
tions, both by directly pertinent con-
ferences and by specific review study
and especially to those. departments
which have volunteeréd exeused cuts
during the last week of classes. On
the other’ hand, some departments

have shown lack of cooperation and|

have given no indication of what to
expect in the third week in May. Such
an indication, coming now, seems al-
most. futile unless we are given the
time in which to make use of its In
view. of the position in which we find
ourselves, we would like. to make two
proposals, which seem not only sensi-
ble but necessary if we are to do our-
selves, and the college, justice on
these examinations.

First, we request, that seniors be
given excused cuts from their elective
and required courses—at their own
risk—during the last week of classes.
If the professors examine us on ma-
terial covered in that last week, the
loss shall be ours. We realize that
the administration has been generous
in releasing us from examinations
our elective subjects, but we feel
obliged to ask for more, We are con-
vinced that a completely free week is
absolutely essential to prepare for the
final examinations in the major field,
if the wide range of material is to. be
covered.

Secondly, we feel it impiative that
seniors be released from major work
during the last week. Since the
avowed purpose of the new system is
to give the student a broad view of
the field, we believe that the import-,
ance of an ifitegrating review far out-
weighs that of the last three lectures
and their. connected reading and
laboratory work. In any. case, we do
not see. how we can carry new work
and at the same time give the neces-
sary, uninterrupted concentration to
our review.

We have heard that all of the col-
leges in the Five College Conference,
which give such final examinations,
give their seniors at least a week’s
reading period directly before.the ex-
aminations. We ask for that same
minimum. iy

proved by. a majority of the Senior
Class. ; .

Dean Explains. Liberal Attitude
Toward Comprehensives



Music Room, May 4.—In chapel this
morhing Mrs. Manning disclosed to
the college the decision of the faculty

whiehthe seniorssrecently petitioned:
it has been found impossiblé to grant
such a period because of the short
time remaining before examinations
start. However, in token of the fac-
ulty’s “deep sympathy” with the
seniors in their “dire troubles,” it has
been decided to allow unlimited senior
cuts during Wednesday, Thursday
and Friday of next week.

Mrs.- Manning also brought up the
proposition rejected later in the day
by seniors of holding the final ex-
aminations in the afternoons, so as
to solve the problem of inadequate
space in Taylor.

Once more Mrs. Manning defined
the position of the faculty with re-
gard to comprehensives.
yery-strongly the folly of too much
cramming on unimportant details and
suggested that rest and thought would
be of more value for most people in
preparation for the coming crisis than
wearisome thumbing over old notes.
She assured the seniors that the com-
prehensives were really “comprehen-
sive’; that there will be an extra-
ordinary amount of choice of ques-
tions; and that considerable freedom
will be: allowed in.the methods of ap-
proach. It is hoped that the examina-
tions will show the students’
of fundamental principles rather than
a top-heavy supply of factual infor-
mation. At any rate, as Mrs. Man-
ning said in conelusion, the marking
will not be_too strict; and the gen-
eral attitide of the faculty will be
tolerant, at least during the next few
years while our comprehensives are
still in an experimental state.

Mrs. Manning will be in her office
all day Thursday to discuss with the
seniors specific probléms raised by
the comprehensives.



The Lantern to Change
Present Election Policy



(Especially contributed by Sylvia
Wright, ’38.)

The Lantern Board has decided to
inaugurate a new system of try-outs.
The present method is likely to make
the mental approach of the board in-
bred Pecause there is no influx of
new opinion throughout four issues.
Furthermore, the board is obliged to

decide permanently on the basis, of
one creative and one eritieal pis of
work, which do not give suf-

ficient indication of talent. The only
alternative to this method is one which
the board wishes to consider beneath
its dignity, that of stealing papers.
from the English basement, which,
while it gives the board more perspec-

them (with apologies to the English
basement) struggling with academic
impedimenta and therefore not quite
at their best.

To give the candidate more chance
to show her abilities, the board has
decided that for each of the next three
issues it will take on as contributing
editors two different people; and it
will make its final decision from these
six after the second issue next year.
The third issue will be produced by
the combined boards, which will give
the new board an opportunity to work
together under the supervision of the

‘lold--before they produce an issue of

their own. The new board will, as a
whole, be better trained, although its
individual members” will not - have
served on the Lantern as long as in

when the majority of the board is in
one class and only one or two meni-
bers are left, as will be the case next
year. The. greatest disadvantage is

“‘teditors about their status, and their

use their lecture-system, they encour-
age the girls to talk themselves, thus
relating their personal experience to
‘the courses which they are studying:
As these’ are generally connected with

it would be to regular college stu-

Apropos of your editorial in-.the
February ninth issue, I should like
to clarify a few confusing points
about the Peace Council and its pfo-
posed constitution.

Until the present, the Peace Coun-
cil has existed as an informal com-
“mittee under the Undergraduate As-
sociation, consisting of the presidents
of the Undergraduate and Self-Gov-
ernment. associations and of chtbs on
campus, or their proxies, as well as
the editors of the .@ lege News, the
rbook, or their
proxies. Recently the activities of the
Peace Council necessitated a more
clearly defined position in relation to
what it should and should not be al-
lowed to do in the name of the cam-
pus. There was also the geriéral feel-
ing that since the activities of the
Peace Council were so numerous and
required’ a great deal of time, it-would
be better to have it consist in elected
representatives from the clubs rather
than their presidents. A committee
was appointed to draw up ‘a state-
ment as to the relationship. between

This: developed into. the form of a
constitution.. However, it must be.
made clear that the majority of pro-
posals criticised in the editorial, of
the College News had _not_vet.
discussed by the Peace Council “and
were therefore not by any means in
final form. ;

We who once worked ourselves into,
a wild state of collapse over a Fresh-
man Show can imagine how the fresh-
men must have felt when they read

the criticism of their efforts in last]

week’s News.
-- Criticism is expected, for such a
production, prepared as it is in two

| weeks, has never and can never be

intended as a professional perform-
ance. Criticism, however; which is not
only not constructive, but even face-
tious is ""inexcusable.

We admit that the criticisms were
deserved, but was it necessary . to
flaunt..the flaws as positively while
ignoring the praiseworthy points? In
such a comment as “against this sul-
try background minced two
attractive if meaningless lovers,”
would it not have been fairer to the
actors. to have omitted “if meaning-
less?” We were truly entertained
by this delightful couple and to us it
was irrelevant whether they were
vital to the plot or not.

It is well that the critic confessed
that she was asleep. Otherwise there
wouuld seem to be no excuse for one
to slide over so carefully without
praise, the truly excellent parts of the
production. Farce without jokes?
Perhaps she missed, “Suspicion puts
tacks in the bedroom slippers of life.”
Surely few, Freshmen Shows have
given such ‘a,smooth and finished per-
formance. quickness with which
actors picked up their cues was. al-
most professional. And when have we
seen on Goodhart stage such a well
directed scene as that around ‘the
ping-pong table?

However, it is not the excellencies
which the critic failed to point out,
nor--the-actual-criticisms which were
made, for, as we have said, they were
justified, but it was the whole tone
of the article which made us see red.

It seems to us that when News re-
views become vehicles for displaying
an individual cleverness and blasé at-
titude toward college tradition at the
expense of an honest account of things
as they are, criticism loses its value.

Such a supercilious attitude toward
Freshmen Shows as has been pre-
valent in the News in the past few
years certainly shows a lack of sym-
pathy and understanding of the aims
and purposes of this nidscrbagie pro-
duction.

Although we were hardly rolling in
the aisles, yet we thoroughly enjoyed

tourselves—and we feel ourselves in-

debted. tothe freshmen for a most en-

tertaining evening. .

OLD CLOTHES DRIVE
BENEFITS HOSPITAL



(Specially contributed by Jane A.
Jones, ’40.) °”

The old clothes drive sponsored by
the Bryn Mawr League is held an-
nually for the benefit of the Bryn
Mawr Hospital. Our contributions to
the drive are sold at the Thrift Shop
of the hospital to the poor people on
the Main Line and even from Philadel-
phia. The Thrift Shop is run by the
Social Service Department of the hos-
pital and the proceeds go directly for
sick service to the poor. In past years
the Bryn Mawr clothes have netted as
much as $1,000 for the hospital and
consequently they are greatly appre-
ciated. The Bryn Mawr Hospital has
always been ready ‘to place its facili-
ties at the disposal of the college, and
this drive is one way in which we can
repay the hospital for its fine coopera-
tion.

of Mr. Spallazani. Not seldom, he
harks ‘back to the elassi¢s for~his ma-
terial, thinly disguising himself as
Socrates. “The more a man knows,”
he says, “the more he knows how little.
he knows.” Mr. Spallazani runs the
gamut of intelligence from A to Z,
sticking for the most part around M.
Here, is an A axion, of the wistful,
childlike variety: “I wonder if it is
possible for one God to give individual

Tattention to every one of the billions

of prayers that are said every day?”
Mr. Spallazani also-likes to make
terse, hard and fast rules like “Faith
is the ability to believe that which is
not true,” and bitter world accusa-
tions; e. g., “Many an innocent man
has been hanged because he acted
guilty.” There are political axioms,
“minorities have.ruled many times, but
there-_has.never_been _a—_dictator.”
(?), and practical axioms, “Might as

‘well eat, drink and be merry if you

have the price, the next depression
you'll £9 broke anyhow,” and etiquette
gentleman is a “ladylike
man.’ Then there are really world
shaking axioms that cannot be classi-
fied—Number 246 “Gold _ itself, as
money, can be inflated. See GOLD, a
novel by Stewart Edward White.”

Unhappily for Mr. Spallazani, we
do not. think that the American pub-
lie will be- bowled over by the novelty
of his philosophy. We hope that he
will get some deserved notoriety when. -
his students recognize. his style, and
that academic oppression will not
‘trample him helplessly under foot:

‘| We will try to remember that “life

is a comedy and not a tragedy and
that is why THE DEVIL LAUGHS.”

We want to preserve hoops, but. it
seems to us that some other method
would be better for passing them on
to the underclassmen. We suggest
that the seniors carry a single hoop
merely to roll on May Day morning.
The seniors can then pass on this hoop
and their other possessions between
May Day and commencement. This

preference or neglect... We would in

sentimental but surely this is a de-
lightful form of sentimentality. What
can compare with a “Hepburn Hoop,”
or a hoop dating from 189—? Would
‘you wantonly condemn these to the

To the Editor of the College News:

We all agree that Little May Day is
a moderately silly custom. Without
hoops it loses what little significance
it has. But childish as it is, it is not
so. childish as people who regard
hoops as the criterion for popularity.
The group of those who do, moreover,
is largely composed of Pollyanna girls
who smugly harbor their own May
Day trophies and who feel a consum-
ing sympathy for the less fortunate.
Most of the less fortunate, on the
other hand, seem to loye May Day.
So it appears that the whole college
is considering changing its traditions
for a wvery small group of sensitive
souls.

The giving of a hoop is a very
pleasant trivial gesture from a depart-
ing senior. It is pleasant for those
who get them, and trivial for those
who do not.

If the general feeling is that in-
dividuality should be smothered and
everybody have hoops from every-
body else or no one haye any hoops
at all, why not replace Little May |
Day with a Communist Demonstra: .

The current A. S. U. membership
drive and the preparations for the

~. April 27th Peace Demonstration make

it appropriate at this time to bring
up the question of the relationship
of the A. S. U. to current student
opinion.

It is obvious that Bryn Mawr stu-
dents will never be in complete agree-.
ment on social and political problems.
Something would be radically wrong
if they were. On the other hand it
is axiomatic that students, whatever
their opinions, should take an active
interest- in local, national, and in-
ternational affairs. Therefore the
college offers courses in Economics,
History, Politics, Psychology and
Social Economy. Extra-curricular or-
ganizations also exist.. The League is
primarily interested in all-important
local and individual problems. The
International Relations Club and the
Peace Council cover the wide field of
‘world affairs. The A. S. U. is a na-

“tion-wide organization, with chapters

on two hundred campuses, which em-
phasizes the positions of the student
in relation to social problems and
vorks to defend academic freedom in
coNeges that are not as fortunate in
that respect as Bryn Mawr.

I jook on the clubs as an oppor-
tunity for students to put their
knowledge and ideas to the sear of
practical_ application-——U ‘
aculty, they leis
their successes and by their fail-
ures. Certainly student organizations
often think wrongly. They have aften
been criticized, but they justify them-
selves because they have educational
value. There are two reasons why
the A. S. U. has been criticized more
than the other clubs. One is that
it deals with controversial issues in a
way that is sometimes provocative.
The other is that although much un-
friendly criticism comes from outside,
not enough constructive help comes
from within. The present member-
ship drive is primarily directed to-
wards those liberal critics who agree
with only a part of the A. S. U.
program. We invite them to join and
“work from within”.

To belong to the American Student
Union, one must agree with a part
of its platform, but it is not neces-
sary to agree with the whole of it.
The program is changeable and is de-
termined by the membership. Con-
troversy is a valuable: stimulus to
thought. ""Members who disagree with
the national program adopted at the
Vassar ‘Convention, are free to act in
opposition to that program and to try
to change it at the next convention.
The only restriction on them is that
they should not use the name of the
‘A. S. U..for causes that it officially
opposes."

music used to be heard coming ove1

singing starting in the distance and
coming steadily nearer added an in-

only fair to have some clue to it. It
is more stimulating, for example, to
know that an abstract painting. is

ask such a question as,
“Ts it only becAuse mind darkness

most improbable, “half remote soft-

tangibility of the indifferent.” Words
used like these have no positive mean-

Renninger’s poem with “blabs.”
Hester Corner, who has written real
poetry, runs into a cul-de-sac in Ab-

cannot. sympathize with such an
esoteric . agony, the subject itself
seems inadequate. Miss Corner uses
familiar words and objects to suggest
abstraction and this gives her poetry
its power; here there is beauty of
word selection without a transcending
idea. Span by Joan Gross is real and
suggestive; its jingling satire is very
effective, especially the last four lines,

The U.S. Committee of the Inter-
national Student Service, upon the
réquest of Dr. J. U. Ly, chairman of

the ‘National Student Relief Commit-|~

tee in China, appeals to the colleges

, in America for a sum of $50,000 to

aid 35 colleges in China for the year
1938-1939. To this appeal the Bryn
Mawr College Peace Council has re-
sponded with its vote of co-operation.
~ The $50,000 are urgently needed by
the 85 colleges which have been de-
stroyed in the invasion and whose
students have moved or are moving
into the interior of China. In the
mass migration of civilian’ popula-
- tion, 70..per cent of China’s students
participate. By foot, ox-cart- and
sampan they have traveled more than
one thousand miles, amidst torrid
heat and severe cold, and through a
war-harrassed country often visited
by bombing planes, in order to reach
the western frontier of China, where
they may hope to settle down to study
in bomb-proof caves. One group has
reached Kunming after a continuous
march of 67 days. 1

Most of these studgnts have lost
their own means of supply, and need
food and clothing to keep them from
collapse under the strain. American
friends and fellow-students can help
to keep them alive and can strengthen
their morale. Mr. J. Michael, who

More than three-fourths ‘of the

American people, according te the

Gallup Poll, hope for a Loyalist vic-
tory in Spain. Yet they are not ex-
erting their full pressure in the cam-
paign for lifting the embargo, a meas-
ure which would insure that. victory.
Qne cause for their inertia is the at-
titude of defeatism in the Democra-
cies which has existed throughout the
war, but has inereased since the loss
of Barcelona.

What has given rise to the belief
that the Spanish Republic is doomed,
that our help would come too late?
Surely the facts point to no such:con-
clusiofi. The strength of Spain is by
no. means broken. “We are deter-
mined to fight on. We still have ten
provinces, five hundred miles. of coast,
ten million anhabitants and a good
fleet-—why should we ask for peace?”
said a spokesman for the Spanish
Embassy in London. General Moles-
worth, British military observer and

, member of the Non-Intervention Com-

mittee, estimates’ that - the Central
Front, around Madrid and Valencia,
can. hold out for three or four years.
The: Spanish people, their government
and their army, welded into closer
unity than ever before, are preparing”
to make any sacrifice rather “than
surrender. If the Loyalists are given
their legal right to buy arms, they
will not only hold the Central Front,
but will drive the invaders out of all
Spain. Such a defeat for fascism
would mean new strength for de-
moeracy throughout the world’: the: re-
lease of France from imminent dan-
ger of attack, the stimulation of pro-
gressive forces in France and Great
Britain, the retardation of fascist ac-
tivities in the Americas, and the
threat of collapse to the tottering)
economies of Italy and Germany. A
Loyalist victory in Spain would do



But if the people of the United
States are misled into. thinking the
Eoyalist cause hopeless, they will

‘| make “no move te aid the Republic.

This is. exactly what the spreaders
of defeatism want; for they represent
powerful sections of American finance
capital, allied with German and
Italian fascism,. Such men,as the Du-

in the aggressions of, Hitler and Mus-
golini; and Morgah is closely con-
nected with British banking, which is
linked with Rome and Berlin. In
order to promote these interests, they
make every attempt. to prevent the
NMRmerican people from using their
power to stop fascism. Through their
‘spokesmen—Herhert Hoover, Senators
Vandenberg, Nye,. Johnson and others
—the reactionaries. try to block every
move of the Roosevelt. administration
toward a, foreign policy of concerted
self-defense by the democracies. They
use pacifism, isolation and appease-
ment as a blind. for granting unlimited
concessions to .the aggressors. De-
featism, which leads to complete pas-
sivity of the democrati¢-forces, finds
a logical place among these weapons
of reaction.

The influence of the press in foster-
ing defeatism has shown itself un-

Now, when ~évents have disproved

Daily Worker is the only paper which
has given a consistently truthful ac-
count of the situation in Spain. By
accurately reporting the war, by ex-

During the archaic period, incised
lines were used for decoration. The
artist, unable to simulate the plastic
world without detail, yet searching for
a plastic means of expression, turned
to raised lines and ridges. -He was
successful because “a néw sense of

indications.”

The raised line now began to serve
a double purpose. Not only was it
decorative but it achieved the power
to model“the figure and thus gave rise
to’the classical line which had the
formal function of indicating the
shapes of the surfaces. As a further

to the idea that wit the«coming of spring, the Lantern declares

The-college has become pert

intention of dying. Actually, it never does, because the Lantern—
meaning’ simply the college literary publication—will not collapse
until the campus wants nothing further to do with literary publica-

tions.

We do not believe that this is likely in the near ffiture.

More-

over, the present Lantern will not collapke) unless greater college sup-

port is given to a rival publication,

for the present editors are perma-

nently and critically interested in writing.
Ideally, we wish that any group with a clear idea of what the

magazine should be would: organize

and-produce-a_rival_next_year, but

from the monetary angle, we doubt if the college and available adver-

tisers could support two magazines.

This ledds us, with some hesita-

. tion, to propose that if. there are any potential rival editors, they
should be given a chance to bid for next year’s Lantern. They could
collect any writing, done in the past year, wMich they consider “Lan-
tern material,” and have this material mimeographed apd circulated
so that a vote could be taken by the college. —

We propose this vote with hesitation because we do not wish to
imply that the college as a whole can or should exercise any control
over Lantern editorial policy. No magazine of any vitality will be
produced unless its editors’ have a clearly defined idea of what the
Magazine should be, and what kind of writing they wish to see” pub-
‘lished. .As a whole, the campus has no such defined policy.
| Rather, we suggest the vote only, in the hope that it may lessen
present incoherent attempts of the college to change the Lantern.
The board now has a defined policy, aiid should not be expected to

_ modify it against its own better judgment.

But because two maga-

Zines are financially impractical, and because there may be—a—clear
alternative policy with energetic backers, we think a vote could be

P . taken, though it should never be assumed that the elected board must
‘the future mold its particular selections only by reference to college

likes and dislikes.

The matter now hinges entirely on the ability of

some, rival group to concretize a new Lantern before next fall, when
the ae must be renewed. No vote can be taken on the present

board versus the campus.

fective. She was O. K., and set
off the cast.

Fourth Paragraph—The rest of
‘he cast provided at least “sub-
stantial” support. It did its best,
no doubt.

“As in last year’s play, the male
parts were taken by members of
the Haverford Cap and Bells.”

I should like to raise a feeble’
voice in defense of the first year!
English literatyre course which

was so bitterly criticized in D. H.}
S.’s letter of last week.

I took the course in- my sopho- |
more year, in spite of the fact that’
I had previously read most of the)
selections on the reading list
(many in toto which were here as-|
signed only in part), because I,
thought a survey course served 2,
purpose which was not served by
courses covering more specialized
periods. And I found the reading
interesting, the lectures often
stimulating—sometimes very excit-
ing. There were, of course, sev-
eral reasons for this, but there is
one in particular to which I would
like to call attention. :

I believe quite firmly’ that one
of the most valuable experiences in
learning involves the active coor-
dination by the student of material
with which she has dealt in her
various courses. (Our comprehen-
sive system is specific evidence that
this belief is fairly generally
held.) But while it is easy for
the average student to see that
such coordination is to be desired,
it is harder for her to learn to do
it herself. Moreover, it is a very
difficult process for a teacher to
explain, since it is one of the
things which can only be learned
by doing. Because this is true,
any arrangement which can point
the way to a mastery of the pro-
cess is valuable. ves

I’ found such an arrangement in
the parallelism which runs in the
second semester, through first year
English literature and first year
philosophy. At almost the same
time, seventeenth and eighteénth
century thinkers were being
studied in both courses. The com-
parison was fairly obvious, and
the process of comparing fascinat-
ing. Both centuries concerned are
beautiful examples of the way in
which similarities of thought can
be traced in philosophy, science,
literature, and sometimes in eco-
nomic and political philosophy. I
was able to learn more from each
course because I was taking the
other, and the experience was in-
valuable.

This parallelism still exists, and
since it is quite the usual proced-
ure to be taking these two courses
at once, many people could use it
who seem not to. (Moreover, I am
told that there are other equally
exciting parallels: that with first
year music, at least as it was
previously given, has been some-
times cited as an example.)

I have, also, a few fairly ir-
relevant points of argument with
D..H. 8. In the first place, I think
the fact that a girl who writes and
thinks ‘well is able to pass an Eng-
lish course of thé basis of what
she has read in a HYmarx outline"

self to saying she isn’t someone,
she says she is Anna Ingram, ’43,

mediate suspect, was non-plussed.
Said she knew she wasn’t Anna,
and she doesn’t write letters. So.
Our Woman Livingston  ¥eports
Gloria an honest, willing girl, not
the shifty type.

The only clue left is the fact
that Exhibit B was handed-to the
News by Anne Updegraff, ’42,
French House inmate, who claims
to have gotten it from a freshman
in Rhoads. Actually, no one in
Rhoads could have done it.-They’re

Freshman Capers Charm
With Songs and Satires



Continued from Page One

across. Less successful were the
solos, which were usually pitched
too high to permit either clear
enough enunciation or enough
noise.

Natalie Bell, as Eleanor, dis-
played a liberal amount of the
impersonator’s talent, but was at

times hampered by bad timing and

poor lines.
Agnes Martin, as the “fickle
Franklin, who succumbs tempo-

rarily to the charms of the Ben-
nington girls, came close to steal-
ing the show. Her performance

was a masterpiece of unselfcon-
ciousness and a Roosevelt imper-
sonation to end all Roosevelt dittos.
Particularly effective was the wild-
eyed announcement: “Quick! Pull
up the fireside—I feel a chat com-
ing on.”

A poignant characterization was
that of Phyllis White as the Crea-
ture. Her agonized contortions
formed a highly effective blot on
the flowerlike beauty of the Vassar
scene.

The second act proved a trifle
anticlimactic. This was caused in
part by the lengthy auctioning of
the posters, during the entre’acte,
a practice which enjoys our hear-
tiest disapproval.

' The best scene in the second
act was the History Class under
the able leadership of Patsy Mc-
Knew as the Dean. Least effec-
tive was the English basement
episode in which nine of the pro-
fessors were given adequate oppor-

. tunity to display what talents they

might have had. The exception
was Harriet Houston as Mickey
Finn, who needed no lines to put
across a practically perfect imper-
sonation.

The rather chaotic finale was
improved by the reappearance of
the wild-eyed Miss Martin. After
the usual breathless pause, an ant
in a test tube was’ neryced and
Goodhart rocked, to the’ assorted

classical cheers of the audience. -

I should like to defend the Re-
quired Philosophy Course as it now
exists. Not that I feel that the
suggestion made by J. M. B. is
without foundation; for there are
many students who would like’ this
type of course. But, on the other
hand, there are many who have
benefited or who are benefiting,
from the course at present for the
‘very reason that she sees for
changing the course.

During the controversy over the
course in First Year English Liter-
ature A. L. A. wrote a letter to the
News in which she remarked that
there is a certain inherent pleas-
ure and satisfaction involved in
doing one’s own correlating as be-
tween courses. And there are
many of us-who prefer to have
the professor give a course in
whatever way he chooses within
the outlines laid down by his de-
partment, in order that we may
get out of it what we choose.
Courses which are intended to cor-
relate and think for the student
are dangerous. We have come to
college to learn to think; our
thinking processes, therefore, are
not inéapable of discovering and
fixing in our minds the connec-
tions that there are between his-
tory and literature, or the litera-
tures of different countries, or be-
tween philosophy, science, and
politics, or whatever one likes. The
relationships remain more firmly
fixed in one’s mind when the indi-
vidual’s explorative curiosity has
sought them out.

The Philosophy Department at
Bryn Mawr is well-known for the
divergent teaching methods of its
members. Smoking-room bull ses-
sions establish, however, not only
these divergencies, but divergen-
cies of opinion or feeling obtained
by each participant in the course
‘as a result of her background or
her intellectual interests as com-
pared with those of somebody else.
This, if nothing else, proves the
value of such a course. The pro-
fessor puts into it what he will;
the student correlates it with. what-
ever other course she takes in her
major field or otherwise. A course
designed to do the correlation fof
the individual would be impossible.
We are fortunate in having an
educational system which enables
us to use our mental powers to
whatever slight extent we may be
able to, gaining perhaps less grasp
in many cases of the infinite con-
nections a field like philosophy has
with other fields, but knowing at
least that we have taught our-
selves to utilize the information
that we have and that we do not
need somebody to do it for us.

Dr. Torres-Rioseco, the Flexner
; lecturer, spoke on Pan-American-
ism, its history and the prospects.
for its future development. Con-
sidering the European conflict, he.
believes the necessity for mutual
understanding between the United
States -and Latin-America is
greater than ever. Toward this

end, he suggested more intelligent.
cultural and economic co-opera-
tion, the only basis on which a
stable and friendly political rela-
tionship can be founded.

Dr. Torres-Rioseco outlined some-
of the steps which must be taken
if Pan-Americanism is to progress.
A cultural exchange should be de-
veloped. Spanish should be re--
quired in our schools as is English
inthe schools of Latin-America,
where it is fast replacing French
as the language of culture. Inter=
American relations should be con-
ducted on an equal basis, especially
in economic fields where the ten--
dency has been for U. S. industrial
concerns to look upon South
America as a gold mine to be ex-
ploited to its fullest extent, while
the republics on the other hand
have tended to regard the United
States simply as a rich uncle, the
source of unlimited loans. He
praised the equalitarianism of the.
reciprocal trade agreements, which

opes -will be so developed as

ake the place of South Amer--
ica’s trade with Europe, particu-
larly that conducted under the
barter system of the Nazis.

There are four reasons which ac-
count for European trade suc--
cesses in South America: The bar-
ter agreements, cheaper produc-
tion methods, a better understand-
ing of the customer’s psychology,
and a willingness to leave South
American"" politics alone. The
United States’ most sipnat fail-
ures have been on the last two
scores. We must try to produce
for the needs of South America in-
stead of using it as.a dumping
ground for our unwanted sur-
plusses, and we must learn the
diplomatic approach. The “high-
pressure salesman” is a failure
when dealing with Latin-Ameri-
cans. Our representatives should
speak the language and understand
the culture of the men with whom
they are dealing.

Dr. Torres-Rioseco also briefly
traced the development of” Pan-
Americanism. During the years
when the Platt Amendment was in
force and marines were sent to
protect United States’ interests in
Central America, Pan-American-
ism was a farce, but with the con-
ference at Montevideo the dream
of the great South American pa-
triot, Simon Bolivar, began to
take shape. Dr. Torres-Rioseco
called Franklin Roosevelt and Hull
the first North American states-
men ever to understand Bolivar
and, therefore, the sits of Latin-
America. -"

Flexner Lecturer Describes
Abusive Social Conditions
Of Latin-Americans



Music Room, March 18.—In the
last of the Flexner lectures, Dr
Arturo Torres- Rioseco described
the Latin American novels-of the
soil and their beginnings.

Literature, Dr. Torres said, has
the same predominant part in Lat-

in American culture that industry
and economics have in North
America. The novelists today are
a great force for social reform. No

longer held to aristocratic and!

bourgeois -subjects they expose the
abuses of the lowest strata of soci-
ety and draw realistic pictures of
the sufferings of Indians, rubber
workers, peasants and plantation
workers, poor fishermen along the
coast, and prostitutes, - jailbirds,
and factory workers in the cities.
Their realism is a far cry from

that of Blest Gana, the “American/}+

Balzac” in the last century, be-
cause they are completely original
and American. Moreover, what
little European influence is found
in Latin American literature today
comes no longer from France but
from~Russia and, ‘Marxism.
- The first stirring*’social novels
caused a sensation.from one end
of America to the other. Santa,
a Mexican story depicting the suf-
ferings of women in prostitution,
was such a one. Many new walks
of life were explored—meat pack-
ing houses, jails and sailors’ homes.

The new field of.-social subjects
was broadened even further, in the
early twentieth century, by~ the
North American menace. The

We believe that in the last four
years the Self Government Asso-
ciation has ceased to be an effective
organ. During this time we have
seen many instances of the follow-
ing infringements, most of which
have gone unpunished and punish-
ments, when inflicted, have been so
mild as to be useless and ridicu-
lous:

‘1. Exits and entrances after
10.30 through windows in
Rhoads, the fire door in

only an infringement of the
rules, but a fire hazard.

going to classes in trousers.

5. Smoking in the Main Line

We suggest the following cor-

matter of feeding the people who

‘live in France, Holland, Belgium

and the conquered areas of Europe.

“The answer that Great Britain
does not approve, which is accepted
by so many people as sufficient
reason for turning down the
Hoover plan, is really not an an-
swer after all. For next door to
France food is being sent to Spain
to feed Gen. Franco’s people. Why
is the British blockade relaxed
there? Because it is to the diplo-
matic interests of the Byitish war
policy to do so.

“This merely means that Great
Britain does not withhold food
from the Axis-dominated areas be-
cause of a belief that the food
might fall into German hands, but
because it is not considered strateg-
ically desirable. to let the food
through the blockade at this time.
It is not a military, but a morale
problem.

“It is not surprising. that the
one man in the world who has had
a vast experience with feeding
large numbers of people in the last
war should be today the stanchest
advocate of food relief. It is more
surprising that what was _per-
mitted in the last war is not tol-
erated in this war, though every-
body knows the food sent to occu-
pied Belgium in the last war did
not reach the German military
forces or prevent the German
defeat.

“The problem is not ‘simply a
humanitarian burden of the most
stupendous sort. It is a problem
of. strategy which.may affect. the
outcome of the war _ itself.

“Would the war come to a
quicker end if peoples in the occu-
pied areas starved? Is it thought
that resistance is increased when
men are hungry, or will it happen
that the occupied peoples will find
themselves bowing to the con-
querors and giving up the instru-
ment of passive resistance which

has been so powerful in past
history?
“Mr. Hoover has’ launched a

simple plan. He would try an ex-
periment and ample _ safeguards
would be provided to prevent the
food from falling. into the hands
of the Nazis. The establishment
of soup kitchens so that food would
be consumed on the spot under the
observation of American inspectors
is itself an adequate safeguard.
“Officials of the Department of
State here properly refrained from
being a party to the approaches
which: former President Hoover
made to the German and British
governments relative to his experi-

with the statutes in that he clearly

presented the idea as an unofficial

NEWS:

Upon the consideration of the
recent article in the Haverfordian
concerning the relationship between
Bryn Mawr girls and Haverford
MEN, a select group of progressive
thinkers at that “insignificant insti-
tution of learning down the road
from Bryn Mawr” wish to promul-
gate a new realm of thought at that
school “across the tracks.”

We admit that many men of
Haverford have failed to live up to
the expectations of Bryn Mawr
“glamour girls.” Could it be that
Haverford men feel too acutely
their insignificant position when
compared with the “‘polish of Har-
vard and the sophistication of
Yale”; or could it be that the
“little men” of Haverford lack the
S. A. to live up to the requirements
of Bry Mawr which are appar-
ently so much higher than those of
Vassar, Smith, or Holyoke? Is it
that the proportion of Haverford
MEN who appreciate Bryn Mawr
at its best is too small to leave
a permanent impression of Bryn-
mawrites? In this case we believe
that the proportion of “grinds” at
other institutions such as Harvard,
Princeton, and Yale is just as great
as it is at Haverford. “Grass on
the other side of the fence seems
greener.” Similarly it seems to us
that the names of the aforemen-
tioned schools have taken on a cer-
tain enchantment due to their in-
accessibility and distance. Some
Bryn Mawr girls have condemned
Haverford as a whole because of
the evidence of a few grinds.
(Some Haverford MEN have con-
demned Bryn Mawr as a hole.)
On the other hand horn rimmed
glasses do not seem to us to én-
hance our dreams of the ideal date
to the counterpart of which Bryn
Mawr seems to be expecting from
Haverford. Moreover our experi-
ence has shown that Haverford
MEN have found it necessary to
discuss the foreign situation. under
the arches, because evidently many
Bryn Mawr girls wish to keep the
conversation on the high intellec-
tual level for which Haverford
MEN are known. We feel sure
‘that most Haverford MEN would
not object to temporarily descend-
ing from their intellectual pedestal
if Bryn Mawr girls will agree to
do likewise.

Have courage, Bryn Mawr, there
is an ever increasing group of us
who are wiping out this stigma on
our name, and who wish to estab-
lish a new tradition which will be
upheld by ourselves and our pos-
terity. We are reminded in clos-

The graduate students are like

The case in hand: coffee at the
Deanery is a time-honored custom.
The hierarchy of territorial occu-
pation is of equally long standing.
Seniority and precedent have estab-
lished positions which we geek to
perpetuate. The faculty have long
demonstrated their preference for
the east window seat in the center
drawing room. The graduate stu-
dents have customarily drifted into
the west window seat in the same
room. Until recently, the senior
class, as the largest group of coffee
addicts, has taken ‘over the first
drawing room.

She did admit that the carelessness
of students about certain things
was a trial to her. “It makes me
furious to have to spend money on
the grass or repairs when it should
be spent for better wages for the
faculty, improved musical equip-

lack of judgement and have no
originality of thought whatever.
Each. article consists of a list, of

ineffective adjectives sandwiched in
here and there. Those predomin-
ating are “sweet,” “charming,”
“strong,” and others equally non-

have a slap-dash sarcastic attitude
toward all our musical presenta-

The criticism of the Paul Robe-
son concert was exceptionally bad.
It was again full of meaningless
and badly chosen adjectives. “His
voice is strong and sweet. He can
use it incredibly well, and some-
times does.” These are only two
quoted sentences to illustrate my
point. In addition the mere by-the-

String Quartet’s contributions
showed very poor. taste. When we
are fortunate enough to have great

constrained to read it over to my

It is not realized that May Day is entirely the student’s production,
to be planned by them. The extent to which May Day will curtail
activities is up to those who produce it.

The assets of leadership trained in former productions, of
scripts, of two thousand dollars’ worth of costumes, the “good will”

(she’s done it before. Vassar.).

one semester. No papers.)

Forthwith the subject to be taught:

“its subtle (italics ours) uses
through the Courts

As to Bryn Mawr, the House of X

a final blow when

Bryn Mawr College News:

Your issue of December 10 says
that Mr. Vincent Sheean called
the attack on Hawaii ‘‘the greatest
reverse of its kind in the history
of the world.” That invites com-
parison with Syracuse, Santiago
Bay, Port Arthur, the Spanish Ar-
mada. Some of his audience claim
that Mr. Sheean meant to say—
“the greatest disaster in American
naval history.” That would not
be saying so much. There have
been few major disasters in Ameri-
can naval history, and even the
Maine was not a “capital” battle-
ship. But Mr. Sheean went on to
say other things.’ “In 386 hours,”
he said, “we have lost more ships
to the Japanese than England has
lost during the entire war”; he told
your reporter who liked him “very
much” that he believed that the
United States “has suffered the
greatest defeat it has known, that

are on the defensive, completely.”
These are strong words. He also
said that Guam, Wake, and Mid-
way Islands “have all been cap-
tured,” which we now know was
not true on that Monday night, and
which throws doubt on everything
else he said, as a statement of fact.

May I express my utter indigna-
tion at these irresponsible remarks,
made in public on one of the most
difficult days the American people
have ever known? Sheean may
have been right and may have been
wrong. I for one, however, do not
believe that the President. deliber-
ately lied on Tuesday night, and I
do not believe that Mr. Sheean had
on Monday authentic information
denied to the President on Tuesday
and to the rest of us six days after
the event. If.he had not been so
impressed by what Ambassador X
and Senator Y and Expert Z told
him that afternoon;—-had hepaused
for a moment to weigh all possible
reasons for the official silence—
which include the possibilities that
authorities in Hawaii and the Jap-
anese High Command as well as the
President really didn’t and perhaps
still do not know exactly what hap-
pened; in short, had ‘he used his
head instead of his emotions, he
might have hesitated before giving
as statements of fact personal opin-
ions which gave so many people in
this community what may have
been unnecessary horror. - It is
hard to think of Mr. Vincent
Sheean as an idiot, a coward, or a
liar. But unless the facts as finally
revealed confirm his statements,
some one of those epithets must
hold true. Anyone who divides
inaval sailing distances per day in-
to total distances on the map of
ithe Pacific should be able to see
excellent reasons why the final
facts may, and should not be :re-
vealed for a week or more to come.
Mr. Sheean should be ashamed of
himself. Must we really lose our
heads so completely and so treach-'
erously at so early a moment of
our ordeal?

News breaking several well estab-

jor, she is the first non-economics
editor in four years; and she has
been on the NEws board less than
a year. She has, nevertheless, had
a severe and gruelling apprentice-
ship. “Are you busy?” it went—
or better, “You aren’t busy ‘are
you?”—so she was always busy.
Last year she wrote play reviews
and received thousands of scathing
letters; this year she wrote an ed-
itorial— and was called into the
dean’s office. é

The climax came when she wrote
up the College Council. That is-
sue was. submitted to the rewrite
man of an Albany paper. It came
‘back with this cryptie comment
scrawled over the Council write-
up: “This girl must be either very

unlike most churches. It was in

the arrangement of the apse that
it differed. There, instead of an
altar, stood a table on which was
laid a copy of the Scriptures in the
original texts—the Old Testament
in Hebrew, the New in Greek—
usually veiled, but symbolically
opened at the: beginning of every
service. Seven golden candlesticks
rose six feet tall around the table,
bathed in golden light from a
crown shaped chandelier above:
gold, presenting the love of God. A
rich purple light, representing the
love of neighbor, was filtered into
the room from side windows of red
and blue stained glass. In the fu-
ture, the curator explained, the
apse is to be paved with gold im-
bedded in glass, which will repre-
sent the streets of the City of the
New Jerusalem, described in Reve-
lations of St. John as “of pure
gold, as it were, of transparent
glass.” The whole is intended to
symbolize the heavenly city as re-
vealed to St. John.

Materials for the Cathedral are
prepared in wooden workshops, low
lying on the hill climaxed by the
towers and spires of the structure.
“It is the most perfect church in
America,” said Mr. Cooper, with
justification, for no time, expense,
nor effort is spared to make it so.
There is not one straight line in
the building; no two door knobs
are the same.~= Light fixtures,
hinges, chairs, pillars, windows, all
are made separately, painstakingly
by craftsmen imported from all
over the world. The perfection of
the whole is derived from a com-
bination of imperceptible variation
with. unity of conception. Each
detail, in final model, is subjected
to a scrutiny lasting sometimes
many years during which it re-
mains in its intended position in
the church-to be studied in relation
to the whole.

John Pitcairn, first president of
the Pittsburgh Plate Glass Com-
pany left his fortune for the build-
ing. He expected it to be a small
country church for the use of the
little Swedenborgian congregation
which in 1893 had moved from
Philadelphia into the country
where educational work could be
more successfully carried on. It
was his son, Raymond, who drew
up the present plans. The elder is
commemorated by a_ sculptured
head placed in the council room
among the church fathers next to
Swedenborg’s. Today the village
of Bryn Athyn is owned by the
church and governed by members
of the church, most of whom are
Philadelphia business men.

“Do you try to make converts?”
we asked after a pause.

Mr. Cooper looked up. “No, we
believe one is saved-by right living,
not by a particular faith. All the
good go to heaven and the evil to
hell.”

“What is your heaven like?”

“Just like the earth,” he answer-
ed. “There are some things there
we do not know about. The force
of gravitation probably: does not
operate in the same way. But an-
gels have digestive systems; they
live in houses; the children grow
up; and all enjoy doing those
things they liked to do here. There
is neither time nor space in heav-
en; thought brings presence there.
We know’ this because Swedenborg
saw it and told us.”

“And is there punishment in |,

hell?”
-4No,.. hell. is hell because. it is
where evil people congregate, for

there is no possibility of hypocrisy

in after life; one must associate
with those like him.”

This letter is another after-
thought of Mr. Weiss’ talk on
Pacifism.

It seems to me that modern so-
ciety at war leaves only two con-
sistent solutions for someone who
thinks he is a pacifist.

The first one is to leave that so-
ciety and look for one in which he
can live a pacifistic way of life. (I
admit that this is a rather imprac-
tical suggestion now, when there
is practically no such society.) The
second is to oppose openly and to
accept prison or whatever the pun-
ishment might be for’ such an of-
fense. All other solutions are com-
promises and therefore inconsist-
ent.

a soldier.

That is, fundamentally
everyone in thata society is doing
the same thing: we all fight.

I admit there is a difference in
degree of the extent to which any
given individual partakes in the
physical fighting, the killing of an-
other human being from the enemy
side’ But this difference in degree

is not a difference in kind. A so-,

ciety at war can be compared to
the production of a machine by
division of labor. The worker who
makes a wheel or the worker who
puts the whole machine together,
are they not both involved as much
in the production of the machine?

So in a society at war: no mat-
ter what the individual -is* doing,
whether we are so-called “long-
range” or not, we all contribute,
however indirectly and less ob-
viously, to the final product which
is the war machine. We all are
killing our enemies. This even
holds for the so-called “enemy
alien.” Through the restrictions
which are imposed upon him he is,
if negatively, partaking in the war."

_ We are writing this letter to you
in order to bring to the attention

that face non-residents. with re-
gard to assignments in books on re-
serve.

This problem is partly a result
of the recent removal of the gen-
eral weekend privilege and partly
a long-standing grievance,

First, we request that non-resi-
dent students be permitted to take
out over the weekend any books
that are not reserved for any hour
during the weekend by other stu-
dents.

Secondly, we ask that one copy
of those books in which there are
extensive assignments and which
have to be used by non-resident
students be placed on the non-resi-
dent reserve shelf.

We have noticed—that-the.books
on the non-resident reserve are
mainly books used in _ required
courses and that even in this clas-
sification there are deficiencies.
Furthermore, there are in many
cases three copies of books on regu-
lar reserves used by non-resident
students. In accordance with li-
brary rules one of these copies
should be placed on the non-resi-
dent reserve.

‘We realize that this will neces-
sitate some further book purchases,
but we think the expense is fully
justified because, not only will it
eliminate a great deal of unneces-
sary strain from the average non-
resident’s academic life, but it will
also. make available additional
copies to the general student body

As things are, many non-resi-

come’ home to late and cold sup-
pers, to rush out to college on
weekends (after five days of trav-
eling), or else neglect assignments.

Nuts and Bolts

By Jessie Stone, °44



A remarkable coincidence in the
history of college newspapers is the
similarity of subject matter in the
editorials of The Radcliffe News
and The Mount Holyoke News.
Both papers wrote about them-
selves,

Radcliffe called its editorial “The
NEWS ‘Staff: Its Function.”
Mount Holyoke’s was headed “One
For All And All For The News.”
Although the editorials are not cal-
culated to arouse sympathy, they
will doubtless be greeted by smil-

ing nods from collegiate newspaper
editors and business staffs through-
out the country.

According to the Radcliffe paper
“the News is one of the most near-
ly professional of all college activi-
ties.” While Mount Holyoke asks
us to “Consider a moment what the
campus would’ be without a news-
paper!” This rhetorical request
may not have been without unflat-
tering answers.

Nevertheless, there are points
put across by both editorials which
deserve expression on occasion. For
example, the work behind the print-
ed “page, the “most conspicuous
part of the paper,” as Radcliffe
puts it, is seldom recognized by the
entire student body. Remember the
advertising and circulation staffs,
which haven’t the by-lines, but
make them possible.

Mount Holyoke’s editorial intro-
duces a thought that seldom occurs
to newspaper staff members, let
alone the reading public. Turning
out a newspaper becomes rather
automatic, in the sense that the
staff never thinks about the impor-
tance of the publication of campus
information. The Mount Holyoke
News reminds us that “In its pages
weekly are . ... . items of infor-
mation necessary to our daily life
here, as well as information de-
signed to acquaint everyone with
everything.” The ability of a col-
lege paper, or of any paper, liter-
ally to “acquaint everyone with
everything” may be questioned, but
the purpose is valid.

One of the editorials was written
to welcome new staff members, the
other to push a subscription drive.
It is regrettable that such motives
are needed to produce this type of
editorial.

We think that the campus dis-
tinctly needs some informal place
for entertaining boys so that we do
not-have to go into Philadelphia or
desert the campus entirely over
ordinary weekends. It is too bad
that the fun of a college dance and
play is limited to twice a year. The
Soda Fountain ought to be crying
for an annex, if it isn’t, where
there can be vie-dancing, ping-
pong, singing and general sitting
around after ten-thirty. There is
no such place in Goodhart as yet.
The Common room is regularly
used for meetings, and, we think,
should not change its character.
The May Day room is still bare. It
has been suggested that the big
- downstairs Rhoads smoking room
be open until 12.30 for weekend
nights, especially, Sunday. There
are comfortable chairs, a victrola,
bridge tables, a ping-pong table,
and exactly the right amount of
room for such an occasion,
hope that this may be given a try-
out after Christmas, so that it can
be used until another place is de-
veloped.

In your editorial on New Majors
in the last number of the News
you state that until recently only
the science departments have pre-
pared girls for important war jobs.
While it is true that only the sci-
ence departments have given new

‘courses, for this purpose it is quite

wrong to suppose that the students
majoring in the social sciences
have not prepared themselves for
jobs in Washington as important
as those for which the special sci-
ence courses are a _ preparation.
As a matter of fact, the demand
for well trained economics majors
in the Washington departments is
so great that the women’s colleges
cannot begin to meet it. Most of
last year’s economics majors were
placed almost before they took
their AB degrees. There is now
an almost equal demand for ABs
who have been trained in history,
politics, or sociology. The office of
Strategic Services sent one of its
research board to all the women’s
colleges in February, looking for
possible recruits. Incidentally, one
of the qualifications for work in
his office and in many other offices
in Washington is a really good
knowledge of German, French, or
Italian. Needless to say, a knowl-

value all its own.

The plan was mentioned several
times and presented to the Presi-

that she would talk with the Board

were reported, and they were an-

Administration they were fairly
conclusively waived by the Presi-
dent of Self-Government. When
she agreed that the plan should be
tried, it was on her own personal
opinion rather than that of the
Board. There was not adequate |
consideration of the attitude or
opinion of the members of College

The Administration has_ been

Self-Government has been criti-

all the students. There was no real |
sanction by the Executive Board;
on the contrary, the members ex-

Though the proposed system of a

give it a trial. It was a question
of taking an optimistic rather than
a pessimistic view.

It seemed that the students, al-

the arrangement, and inconveni-

some extent. The Administration

From both my own and other
undergraduates’ experience, I
think the Dean’s Office should not
allow students to take Physics
freshman year unless they are tak-
ing First Year Mathematics simul-
taneously. In fact, it would be
preferable to have First Year
Mathematics an absolute prerequi-
site for First Year Physics.

I suggest this because the con-
tent of the First Year Physics
course is not sufficiently compre-
hensible without at least a knowl-
edge of differential calculus and
college mathematical methods. The
only alternative to this proposal
would be a simplification of the
work which would reduce the pres-
ent excellent course to the level of
high school physics.

If this rule were instituted, it
would eliminate both failures and
nervous strain for most students
who take the course. It is a hard
course, but it is well worth getting
the proper background for it in
order to get the full benefit of it.
People who raise the objection that
they want the physics but not the
mathematics, have found that they
get very little physics.

Since serious students of physics
will need the mathematics anyway,
it will merely change the order in
which they take their courses into
a more logical form.

I am referring, in particular, to
a news story in the Philadelphia
Record on March 20 by Orrin C.
Evans. Mr. Evans is a Negro,
who belongs to that ideological
group aptly called “Uncle Toms.”
They have their counterparts
among other oppressed minorities

Mr. Evans’ story was about the
organization of “a squad of 25
carefully selected Negro plain-
clothesmen” whose job would be to
“concentrate on smashing Negro
muggers.”

Herbert E. Millen is another
“Uncle Tom.” He was appointed
Assistant Director of Public Safe-

“crime wave” among members of
his own race. Evans in his article
says of him:

“This unwritten law, incidental-

This unwritten law is something
new. I have heard of “implied

used to denote certain practices on
which the law is silent and whose
existence rests on tradition. But
never has this terminology been

The News has correctly and re-
peatedly stated in its editorials
that the Bryn Mawr campus is
suffering from a permanent and
mortal case of inertia, and, on the
whole, the News has succeeded in
remaining the most alive organ on
the campus. Which is not saying
much. The News can and should
do much more than it is doing to
express the attitude and life of the
572 (?) girls here in college, and
I, for one, should like to see it
done.

In the first place, the editor
seems to be trying to pattern the
paper after the New York Times—
staid, conservative, accurate, and
informative. That is a worthy
néwspaper aim. But a_ college
paper must be more than that.
College girls, even Bryn Mawr
girls, are not so thoroughly intel-
lectual that they must rely solely
on a sporadic Wits End to liven
their “representative” sheet.
Amusing, interesting, human in-

‘terest stories do happen on cam-

pus, even. if the News Board
seems to be somewhat unable to
recognize them as such. A lecture,
such as that of the other night,
should, agreed, be reported as a
straight news story, as this issue
of the News is doing, but there
was more to the Frost evening
than the word for word transla-
tion of what few concrete things
he did say. The audience knew it,
and the News reporters knew it—
and the same is true of most of the
things happening around campus.
If it were only possible to put a
little human interest of any sort,
a little more deviation from the
hide-bound rules of Timesian re-
porting, the News would easily
succeed in overcoming a large part
of the inertia in their readers.

The editors are to be com-
mended for their abandonment of
the nonsensical features about
squirrels on the front lawn and
other such airy space-fillers, and’
the lack of time available is cer-
tainly to be taken into account,
but I feel that with such a large
staff and a slightly proportional
amount of ingenuity, much more
can be done.

The changes that are about to!

take place at the College Inn af-
ford an opportunity to present to
the student body an explanation
which we of the Inn Association
believe is due the students.

The Inn will serve no more din-
ners except on “big weekends” by
reservation. The ration points
put at its disposal by this aciton
will be put into use at tea-time so
hamburgers, frankfurters,  etc.,
will once more be available; There
will also be a buffet tea consisting
of previously prepared food
(doughnuts, sticky-buns, etc.), cof-
fee, tea, and coke to which the
students may help themselves. The
buffet breakfasts which have been
served for the past few weeks and
which seem to have met with con-
siderable favor will continue. On
Sundays, no noon dinners will be
served, but there will be a large
breakfast, served until 11.45, and
at tea time Sunday night supper—
buffet style—will be available.

Because of rationing, food-short-
ages, and help difficulties, the Inn
has found these changes most ex-
igent. We realize that there are
numerous disadvantages in mak-
ing them, however, these are only
temporary changes and there are
numerous benefits that the stud-
ent body will reap from them.

I believe the following par-
agraph may clear up the confu-
sion that has rankled in the minds
of many of our undergraduates as
to the exact status of the Inn. In
1913 when the College Inn became
active for the first time, it was

May I make a few corrections

in the “News” of December sec-
ond?

As far as I know, employers
have not changed their policy of
accepting inexperienced people,
but the great period of mass hir-
ing is over. There are still many
jobs but new employees are  re-
placements rather than additions.

The demand for women with
training, in economics, mathemat-
ics, (especially _statisties), and
science seems as great as ever.

Training courses for new work-
ers are being cut down but many
are still continuing.

The Programs for Relief and
Rehabilitation are still in the plan-
ning stage. No one can yet say
with certainty whether large num-
bers of comparatively untrained
women will be used; or how or
where or, above all, when. By
June, we may know more,

Before this year, only WACs,
nurses, and Red Cross’ workers
were being recruited for overseas
duty. Now other government
agencies are sending women
abroad, chiefly as _ secretaries—
agencies like the Office of War In-
formation, the Foreign Economics
Administration and the Office of
Strategic Services.

As far as we can see now, there
will be plenty of jobs for students
leaving college in June—perhaps
not the bewildering variety and
numbers open to the classes of
1942 and 1948 but stilla wide
range.

Many apologies to your reporter
for making myself so obscure.

We read your editorial entitled
New Schedule in the January 12
issue of The News. We do not
agree with your suggestion that
the present semester schedule
should be altered. We looked at

‘| the college catalogue to see how

the school year, 1944-1945, was ar-
ranged. There will be quite a few
changes from this year; the most
important one allows classes. to
end on January 19 and examina-
tions do not begin until January
23. This allows more time to pre-
pare for the important examina-
tions of the first semester. The
difficulty in pushing up_ these
tests before Christmas vacation is,
that for a month after November
15 there would be an intense per-
iod of mid-semesters, papers and
mid-years. This would be an un-
necessary complication. ae

Instead we offer a compromise
between the scheduled period of
mid-years and your suggestion
that college begin one week earl-
ier. If college began one week
earlier, then it follows that mid-
semesters should bé put forward
to November 13. Then Christmas
vacation should be from December
15 until January 3. This would al-
low the students who have, to trav-

beginning a week ahead of the
present planning it would be poss-
ible to begin a period of prepara-
\tion for examinations on January

417 until the 22nd. Examinations

would take place from January 22
to February 4 and it would be less
likely for students to have four
exams in-four days (as is happen-
ing this year). The second sem-
ester would begin on February 6

There has been, in recent weeks,
much campus controversy on the
general subject of our self-gov-
ernment. This -controversy has
been expressed in print by sources
whose views are often far to the
right or left of the average stud-
ent’s. As one of these average
students, who make up the major-
ity of the undergraduate body, and
about whom this controversy has
presumably been centering, 1
would like to submit some views
on the situation.

Two specific proposals have been
recently formulated by two differ-
ent sources, for presentation to
the undergraduate administration
and the student body. Both attack
the present machinery of the Self-
Government Association as out-
moded and inadequate. Both were
composed of small groups on cam-
pus. The question now is, or short-
ly may be, in the hands of the
undergraduate body—in the hands
of the majority of average stud-
ents, we who have probably in-
dulged only in smoking room dis-
cussion-of the problem. Any final
decision will be in our hands, and
perhaps most of us fail to realize
the gravity of the situation and its
eventual outcome.

Two Proposals

One of these proposals holds,
briefly, that the Constitution of
the Self-Government Association
should be completely discarded
and a new one drafted by a com-
mittee large enough to ‘represent
all campus opinion. The other
proposal also includes the idea
that changes: are imperative in the
present machinery of Self-Gov’t.
‘But: its thesis is that these changes
should be made through amend-
ment to the: present ‘constitution
so as'to allow the formation of a
large committee, similar to that

jsuggested by the first ‘group, which

would ‘represent campus opinion
and have as its duty the consider-
ation and presentation of altera-
tions in the present Constitution,
in order to bring our self-govern-
ment policies up to date.

New Constitution

The group which desires a new
constitution is the same group
which has sponsored the now well-
perused Lantern editorial and sev-
eral letters to the News. The ques-
tion has been considered, I think,
by practically all the students, but
in entirely too many cases it has
been laughed off. It is no longer
a humorous proposition. They now
propose that we discard a consti-
tution. Why is this group mak-
ing such a proposal? What is to
be its final purpose and what
would it mean to all of us who or-
dinarily wield only the power of
one vote in college elections? This
group maintains that the machin-
ery of amending the constitution
would be lengthy and tedious com-
pared to the simple expedient of
abolishing the entire Constitution
and formulating a new one. But
these words are deceptive and
need careful scrutiny. Amendments
require a petition signed by one-
tenth of the student body, a rati-
fication by two-thirds of the stud-
ent body, and approval by the
Trustees through the Board of
Directors. A new Constitution
would need approval article by ar-
ticle and clause by clause from the
student: body, and final approval
from the Trustees. It seems ob-
vious that the latter is far more
involved and lengthy a procedure.
And what else would this proposi-
tion entail? Before we succumb to

From the point of view of self-
government the past three weeks
have been vital and important.
They have been full of murmurings
and mutterings, discussions and ar-
guments. Last week produced de-
cisive action. I think we have now

back upon the three weeks just
past and evaluate.them. We are
a bit beyond their turmoil, and we
can achieve a more objective view.
Further steps are still to be tak-

experience, it will help us in deal-

Controversy Reviewed
The most important events of the
past weeks were the following:
first, the publication in the Lantern

on February 7 of the extreme ed-

itorial advocating greater free-
dom, especially along the lines of
smoking and drinking. Secondly,
the Assembly presented by the
executive board of the Self-Gov-
ernment Association, a clarification
of the workings and principles
(oh! overworked word) of our
present self-government system.
Thirdly, the News published three
letters. The first of these came
out the same day as the Assembly
and was written by the editor of
the Lantern. It was more specific
in tone than her editorial had been,
and dealt further with smoking
and permission-giving.

The following week the News
printed two letters, a second from
the editor of the Lantern and the
other from “An Individual.” The
former suggested the adoption of
a new constitution. The latter de-
fended our present constitution.
We owe thanks to “An Individual”
for setting forth so clearly the
merits of our system and the ad-
vantages of maintaining it. The
editor of the Lantern expressed
her desire to present her plan in a
more detailed way at a Mass Meet-
ing. This meeting was held last
Thursday evening. The business
was presented systematically and
the debatable points were fully
discussed. The voting held in the
halls that night showed that an
overwhelming majority of the un-
dergraduates were in favor of
keeping the present constitution.

These are the events which
strike one, as one glances back
over the period between the begin-
ning of the semester and the pres-
ent. However, other elements lurk
underneath. We have seen some
amazing things at Bryn Mawr re-
cently. We have seen the college
menaced by subversive and pernic-
ious methods of persuasion. We
have seen girls swept off their feet
by the pleasing phrase, “individ-
ual freedom.”’ We have seen girls
take the course of least resistance.
On the other hand, we have had
the pleasant experience of seeing
girls make a decision and uphold
that decision staunchly.

Amendments

It is undeniable that the under-
graduates want some changes in
their constitution, changes in
smoking and changes in permis-
sion-giving. These will involve
petitions, mass - meetings and
amendments. Last week showed
that we know what we don’t want.
We must now decide what we do
want. Any amendment must be
thought over carefully and delib-
erately. I would appeal to the
student body as a whole to formu-
late constructive ideas, .to offer
measures which will help to per-
fect our present system of self-
government. I would appeal also

to those who voted in favor of a

new constitution to redirect their
energies,. insofar as this is poss-

ibility of requesting a, loan or

their pre-war level. My persohal
suggestion is that the Lantern be
discontinued for the duration.

I feel that a fresh beginning
would be of value. For the last
three years the Lantern has been
criticized for the publication of
only a certain type of story, yet
the members and also the attitude
of the board have changed drasti-



more the campus than the board
which has “typed” the Lantern.
Also the students who would
otherwise be doing creative writ-
ing have more immediate prob-
lems to face at this time—and
Bryn Mawr at best is not a highly
creative college. It is bad, in
theory, to relinquish even a publi
cation like the Lantern because of
the war. We all believe that cre-
ative writing should not be dis-
continued by those privileged to
earry on. Faced however with the
facts of a lack of interest, a lack
of material—based on more than
the apathy a good publicity cam-

the salient fact-of a lack of funds,
I think that this is the best solu-

We wish to question the need
for the letter published by the
president of the Sophomore class
at the request of the class nomin-
ating committee in last week’s
News. By the time this is read
the elections for Common Treas-
urer will be completed, but we feel
that the letter should not pass
without some manifestation of the
indignation which we know many.
have felt concerning it. Our quar-
rel is not with its purpose; there
are surely few people on campus
who do not agree with the prin-
ciple of wider distribution of of-
fices, It is rather the tone of the
letter and its implications which
disturb us.

Inthe first place, it is an apol-
ogy for the office of Common Trea-
surer. The fact—that-its-qualifiea-
tions are contrasted with those for
other “large campus offices” seems
to imply that it is less desirable.
Saying that the presidency of
Self-Gov’t was one instance of a
position for which the holding of
“large offices” is a requisite was
misleading, for we feel that it is
a unique example of an office for
which a period of apprenticeship
on a board is advantageous. With

“every other office we can call to

mind, it seems to us that there can
be no other qualification for a can-
didate than knowing that she is
“good and dependable,” with. an
interest_in_the work.

Secondly, the letter has struck
many as an apology for those girls
running for the office. Its tone is
most unfortunately patronizing.
A sentence such as: “We feel that,
when possible, they (girls such as
the candidates) should be given a
chance to sho wtheir ability in...
impressive offices,” seems an un-
called for apology for members of
the Sophomore class who are,
after all, not as obscure as. one
may be led to believe from the let-
ter in question.

Now that the results of-the_ poll
on Required English Composition
have been analyzed, it seems ap-
propriate for the staff to say some-
thing further about the course. We
do not think that most students,
if they understood the issues,
would wish to see the course re-
duced to the mere imposition of
technique or the mere imparting
of information. (We believe that
the course must be continued as a
liberal one in which the focus is
on the individual] student and the
independence of her thinking. We
have perhaps been mistaken in as-
suming that the relation of these
aims to the teaching of writing
has been clear; but, it is now ap-
parent that the connection has not
been understood.

The majority of students, once
they the
with which we have to deal, will

understand problems

probably want to seé only such
changes made in the course as
will make it better adapted to

the needs of the individual. We
feel it is necessary, therefore, to
give a brief description of those
problems and to outline our prin-
ciples in dealing with them. The
most obvious problem in writing
is the observance of a set of con-
ventions: grammar, spelling punc-
tuation, sentence structure, usage.
On most of these there is general
agreement, and the teacher’s task
is to see that they are observed.
Usage changes with time, how-
ever; the prose of the twentieth
century is not that of the nine-
teenth. We endeavor to take as
our standard the usage of the
best contemporary writers. We
do not hold ourselves responsible
for enforcing outworn conven-
tions; that we should regard as
pedantry. A second problem, one
which goes beyond the question
of convention, is logic: the ar-
rangement of thought within the
sentence, the paragraph, and the
essay as a whole, This—-is——no
superficial question, and a large
part of the teacher’s time is oc-
cupied with it. For the student,
indeed for all of us, logic in writ-
ing is connected with the clarity,
independence, and integrity of
‘thinking. Clear thinking, in turn,
depends upon honest observation
of facts, and upon ability to set
aside self-interest and emotional
bias. Therefore it is necessary
that students should write often
from first-hand observation and
sometimes on controversial sub-
jects.

Correctness and logic are very
important qualities in writing,
but a student often hopes_ to
achieve something further. She
wants to form ,her own manner
of writing, her own style.- This
third problem is difficult and can-

jut more harm than benefit. An
| assumed style is a collection of
mannerisms. A true style is the
direct reflection of an individual’s
manner of thinking;: it is the re-
sult of the convictions and the re-
lationships that make us what we
are, and it is attained only by a
process of maturing. Goethe
said: “the style of b writer is \ a
faithful representative of his
mind; therefore, if any man wish
to write a clear style, let him be
first clear in his thoughts; and if
any would write in a noble style,
let him first possess a noble soul”,

paign this week, I would like to
bring to your attention excerpts
from a letter printed in the New
York Times, July 6, 1944:

“TI believe there would be little
need to appeal for workers—on

mation were given to the public as
to how these are used and why
they are needed in such vast quan-
tities.

“Recently I heard an able work-
er on these dressings suggest that
they all ought to be made on ma-
chines. Like many others, she ap-
parently still did not realize that,
due to various shortages, only 19
per cent of dressings required can
be made commercially. How many
know that the army depends on
volunteers workers for 90 per cent
of the dressings it needs?

“Again how many know that
from 100 to 200 gauze sponges
may be needed to dress an abdom-
inal wound? Or that the multiple
wounds from a shell burst—at
least half of the battle wounds are
said to result from shell-bursts?”

The facts in this letter are not
only accurate but shocking in so
far as so few of us know them.

them, and you cannot forget to

In order to deal justly with a
situation such as this, we _ feel
the need for a wider range of
possible measures, which would
enable the Board to take a more
efficient and just action. After a
long and very careful discussion,
we have decided to introduce “day-
campussing”’, an “in - between”
measure to be used rarely, and
only after the greatest considera-
tion and forethought. This will
by no means be a substitute for
the campussing after 10:30 P. M.
that we know today, but its pur-
pose will be to provide that furth-
er possible measure when the
campussing we have now would
not apply, and when the penalty
of suspension would seem too se-

Reed Urges Bond Purchases;
Campaigns for Missing
36 Per Cent

To the Editor:

Three hours of volunteer work
a week is not the only contribu-
tion we of Bryn Mawr can make
to the war. Buying war stamps
—if less spectacular—is no less
vital. In thinking and planning
for the peace that lies ahead we
must remember that the war is not
over, Much hard fighting lies
ahead if the war is to be carried
to its end. For this we will need
a steady supply of ammunition
and equipment which can be paid
for only by the purchase of War
Savings Stamps and Bonds.

Bryn Mawr’s past record for the
purchase of War Stamps has been
good, and yet it has been poor. A
monthly average of $1000 is good
but only 64% of the campus buy-
ing even a 10c stamp is poor. This
year we are campaigning to get
the missing 36%. It is our chance
to present to the world a united
front. Too long we have let the
64% carry our burden.

On Thursday and Friday, Oc-
tober 12 and 18 you will be asked
by agents in your halls to fill out
pledge cards. A minimum of $2.00
monthly per person would put us
over lastyyear’s figures. You can
afford to give better than you can
afford not to. Pledge—and then
Give! ee
Sincerely,

Mr. Bell’s disappointing speech
to the College, Tuesday, may have
lost some votes for the Republi-

Mr. Dewey not have acquainted

support every statement they can
make against Mr. Roosevelt—par-
ticularly against his foreign pol-
icy bungling—and the Republi-
cans should use these facts.

Has not Mr. Bell read Mrs.
Luce’s speech made in Chicago, a
week ago Sunday? Doesn’t he re-
alize that most Democrats agree
that Mr. R. is a poor domestic
administrator, and that they
merely need to have pointed out
to them how the stupidity at

Dewey column: that, “Mr. Dewey

State to be capable of reducing: a
seemingly rigidly high budget to
a practical low.” Since it happens

When Governor Lehman retired
in January 1948, he left the state
with an 80 million dollar surplus
to be credited on April 15 when
the New York State taxes are
paid. At that time the fiscal year
ended on July 1, and the books
were made up then. When. Gov-
ernor Dewey took office in January
and saw that this 80 million dol-
lars was going to come in on\April
15th and be credited to Governor
Lehman’s administration, he quick-
ly and with youthful vigor had the
legislature move the end of the
fiscal year back to April first, at
which time he wound up Governor
Lehman’s administration. Then,
on April 15th, when the taxes came
in, he claimed credit for the 80
million dollars himself. It was as
efficient as that.

But Governor Dewey supporters
claim that he has saved the State’
of New York double that sum;
they lay claim to a total surplus
of 160 million dollars. Where did
the additional 80 millions come
from? They came from taxes on

An urgent appeal to all “Surgi-
cal Dressings Volunteers” h
just come from the Ardmore doe
ter of the Red Cross. Although
the stocks of Red Cross dressings
in the European theatre ‘tre been
ample up to this times the recent
crucial developments/on the west-
ern front have brought forth an
immediate ne for 45,000,000
dressings. The “Surgical Dress-
ing auxiliariés” all over the coun-
try must meet this new emergency.
Our Bryn Mawr unit is being call-
ed upon to help meet the local
Valléy Forge requirement for 2000
bandages. :

This is a tremendous challenge
in view of the fact that our first
semester record averaged about
200: bandages per week—a mert
drop in the bucket. Here is. a
chance for those of you who were
not able to arrange your program
to fit the Nurses’ Aide course, to
serve in other war work. The new
hours are Wednesday evenings,

/Thursday afternoons;-or—Saturday-|

mornings. One of these times can
fit anyone’s schedule.

We would like to report for the
College Red Cross Unit that,
through the first semester of this
year, approximately 100 students
(nearly 1/5 of the College) per
week were working’ in Red Cross
activities. In addition 12 students
were responsible ‘for the adminis-
trative work of the Unit.

When the total. is broken down
we find that regularly each week,
4 students were learning leather
work, to prepare for teaching

or in Bryn Mawr; 19 Nurses Aides
were’ newly trained; an average
of 25 workers made surgical dress-
ings. The number -of surgical
dressings workers was generally
much higher than 25 early in the
term, and much lower than 25 af-
ter mid-semesters. Through Janu-
ary 13 approximately 676 Army

had been made.

pital’s kitchen have increased from
15 to 20. Eleven wives of faculty
members are Surgical Dressings
workers, and in the week ending
February’ 10 the number of volun-
teers making dressings was. near-
er 50 than 25.

Increased effort has been most
obvious in the enlistment of Nurs-
es’ Aides. About 49 students have
joined the class that is supervised
by the special Faculty Committee;
and.24 are in that supervised by
the College Red Cross. Unit. Thus
many of Bryn Mawr’s graduate
students are doing weekly wolun-

the Faculty-plan Nurses’ Aide
Class. By the end of this College
year the total number of students
who are trained Nurses Aides will
be 109.

Considering the favorable re-
sponse to the dance numbers jin the
i'reshman Show, we teel that mod-
ern dancing should be encouraged
on the campus. “Lhe Physical kdu-
cation Department at Bryn Mawe
has’ frowned upon the modern
dance while Smith, Vassar, and-
Cornell have carried on supervised
programs which have been en-
thusiastically received by the stud-
ents. We would like to see mod-
ern dance emphasized as much as
the other sports in this college.

During only two weeks of re-

hearsals, the dancers in the show
developed great coordination, grace
and imagination in their move-
ments; ~ Most of them had no pre-
vious training, but thanks to their
enthusiasm and hard work, they
gave a polished performance. If
such great strides could be made
in a handful of rehearsals, think
what could be accomplished in ‘a
well organized dance program held
three hours a week throughout the
year. :
At the present time there is only
one two-hour class a week. in
Wyndam. This is an advanced
class. There is no class for be-
ginners who have not had the basic
training necessary for modern
dancing. We think there should
be at least two classes for begin-
ners as well as the one advanced
class. They should be fitted into
the regular physical education
schedule and given the full cooper-
ation of the gym department. .

especially sad.to hear that so many
Seniors had to come to such an un-
fortunate conclusion. If it is true
that that many students feel this
inadequate preparation, the “bit-
er” truth to face is an individual
improvement of studying habits—
(I do not exclude myself). And if
general “action” is still. desired
along with the usual urge for op-
position, it should be realized that
such a move has to be applied to
individual cases, that, in this re-
spect, there should be no general-
ized rule, a rule which is somewhat
degrading in form as well as in
character—to the students as well
as the faculty—(and one which, by
the way, would doubtless ‘result in

‘an anti-quiz-movement in the near

future).

Recent letters to the News
have shown that various facts
about the position of Modern
Dancing on the: campus are mis-
understood or unknown.

The complaint has been’ made
that the Physical Education De-
partment has not given proper
recognition to Modern Dancing
as a sport. ® When a popular de-
mand for Modern Dancing was
first expressed on campus in 1936,
the Physical Education Depart-
ment brought Doris Humphrey, a
dancer of international reputation,
from New York to teach. The
classes were given a place in the
regular gym hours. From about
one hundred members at the be-
ginning the classes shortly dwin-
died to six or seven!

Despite this discouraging at-
tempt and. successive ones, the
Physical Education Department a
few years .ago brought Malvena
Taiz, the outstanding exponent of
the Modern Dance in Philadelphia,
to teach weekly classes. These
now include thirteen members tak-
ing Modern Dancing as a_ sport
with full gym credit. The Phys-
ical Education Department sup-
ports only one other sport, of how-
ever large a following, to such an
extent as to bring in an outside
expert to teach weekly classes.

This: year, we understand, ‘the
English*Comp. course has been re-
vamped, or at least some attempt
was made to encourage Freshmen
to come to class. English Comp.
however, still leaves much to be
desired.

Its main fault lies in the fact
that the sheep are herded with the
goats, so that some really talented
writers and many who have been
thoroughly prepared in High
School are forced to put up with
much time-consuming drudgery.

We realize the difficulty of sep-
arating a new Freshman class into
sections according to their ability

in -the first semester. Consequently.

we suggest that this classification
take place in the second semester.

If this plan were adopted, the
second semester classes at least
could vary according to the needs
of each group. Some might study
modern poetry, others creative
writing, .and those students who
show particular ability might be
excused from the second semester
work altogether. .

The teacher of each group should
be carefully selected. We pity the
teacher who is left to cope with
the dregs of every section, but the
English Comp. department - could
take turns shepherding the goats.

acquiring a new English Comp.

Bryn Mawr is presumably a lib-

|eral arts college; the college cur-

riculum, however, is noticeably
lacking in courses pertaining to
Oriental culture. This means that
a whole sphere of culture is omit-
ted, which is regrettable under any
circumstances, but particularly
serious in view of the necessity for
post-war cooperation with \the
East.

In order to méet the demands of
a new and narrowing world, we
feel that the acquisition of a de-

Social Science Proposed
As Requirement
By Student



To the Editors:

The recent discussion of require-
ments aroused by the Psychology
Poll brings up the subject of the
social sciences as requirement ma-
terial.

Some attempt is evidently made
to graduate well-rounded individ-
uals. Besides a general knowledge
of science, literature, and philos-
ophy, the graduate is expected to
swim, to describe ‘the alimentary
canal, and to read French and
German at. sight. Such accom-
plishments are undoubtedly valu-
able, but no more so than a course
in either politics, sociology, or ec-
onomics. —

If an occasional science major
felt it’ impossible to crowd her
schedule with another required
course, she could perhaps arrange
some solution with the Dean and}
her major— department, while the
average undergraduate, forced to
take a fifth requirement, would
not suffer perceptibly.

Demand for Revamping
Of English Comp.
‘Heartily Seconded’



To the Editor:

“Two dissatisfied freshmen” ex-
pressed in the last News.a demond
for change in the English Comp.
course. I should like to second the
motion heartily.
|. Despite repeated attempts to
explain the purpose of ‘English
Comp. to me, I find that-the most
plausible function of the course
remains “teaching people how to
write papers.” This raises the
question: does English ‘Comp. as
it is now presented do this in the.
most effective way possible?

There is no clearly understand-
able connection between the mater-
ial presented in the first and the
material given in the second sem-
ester. The second-term work deals
with modern writers of prose and
poetry, of internationally recog-
nized excellence; this.is natural in
an English course, ard with this
we have no quarrel.

‘But is there any reason for pre-
senting the Freshman upon’ her
arrival at Bryn Mawr with that
glorious hash of chiefly leftist
writings which goes to make up
first semester English Comp.? It
may be alleged that the average
entering Freshman is incapable of
writing the literary criticism ask-
ed of her or of getting, much profit
from the reading of/ the second
semester. But wouldn’t it be poss-
ible to introduce her /to it through
other less difficult English classics
than through thaf incongruous
composite of “current affairs” and

_ In Collected Stories
Of Arthur Train



by Nancy Morehouse °47
Arthur Train, author of the Mr.
Tutt stories which regularly ap-

pear in the Saturday Evening Post,.

has made a charming collection of
new and old stories in Mr. Tutt
Finds a Way. The stories center
around the activities of the de-
lightfully clever Ephraim Tutt,
“Yankee Lawyer’, who,- retired
from regular practice, devotes his
energies to rescuing the victims
of inequitable justice from a das-
tardly fate through his knowledge
of many obscure legal irregulari-
ties. ..

The adventures of Mr. Tutt are
pleasantly devoid of any psycho-
logical significance: he rescues the
down-trodden from their would-be
oppressors and everything is happy
thereafter. Aside from his cham-
pionship of the ‘unfortunate and
unwitting victims of the law, Mr.
Train is propagating no great so-
cial theories either. He rescues
Georgia and Virginia plantations,
remnants of the old. South, from
seizure by the unscrupulous cred-
itors of their lovely young owners
(feminine), and with equal eager-
ness saves a worthy Negro from

a Voodoo death.

On Monday, April 23, Mr. Post
announced to his Greek Lit. class
that the Dean’s Office had suggest-
ed he should mark the year papers
so that approximately 50% of the

class receive 70’s, 20% 60 or be- |

low, and 20% 80 or above. When
the class protested that they might
be especially bright, Mr. Post said,
“In that case the final exam can
be made so difficult that no one can
get over 80.”

Although merely a _ suggested
marking system, its effect on the
class was demoralizing. Every
piece of work should be given the
mark it deserves and not a mark
determined in advance. Other pro-
fessors apparently do not follow

this system, and to suggest it to

a new profesosr is certainly un-
wise.

This predetermined marking
system seems to us so preposter-
ous that we are sure there must bé
some mistake and hope the Dean’s
Office will clarify their statement.

which might arise, the value ‘of such a program must be
viewed objectively.

The greater the totality of: cada war, the more im-
portant become the economic phases of it. The only way in
which the United States could be economically prepared for
war would be through the adoption of £ program comparable
to Nazi militarism, with a major part of our economy geared
to its demands.

Obviously, any such program would be highly undesir-
able. The institution of military training, moreover, would
be no indieation of our willingness to back. up our commit-
ments. The existence of military training in France was no

to be dramatized since that time.

On Wednesday evening the grad-
uate students had invited me to
help them make packages for’ Ital-
ian orphans. ‘Crossing the campus
from the College Inn to Goodhart,
a great gloom enveloped me, for I
had just been listening over the ra-
dio to a list of the principal events
of the day: Mr. ‘Churchill’s eloquent
plea for the storage in Great Brit-
ain of a few atomic bombs to be on
hand just in case... Mr. Molo-
toff’s assurance to the Russian peo-
ple (and to the world) of the im-
minent discovery by Russian scien-
tists, not only of the atomic bomb
but of other similar weapons. (pre-

‘sumably better), as well; Mr. Tru-

man’s firm insistence that we keep
the atomic bomb secret exclusively
to ourselves for a while longer .. .
It was not-strange that.a desolate
despair gripped me as I contem-
plated the new dance of death just
beginning, the tune set by the
three mighty nations of the world.

. Bomb Blues

Not a dance of death, I reflect-:
ed, such as Holbein might have de-
picted, with death beating the
drum individually for king and serf
alike. Not even a ‘death dance
swift: like the one I once saw carv-
ed around a mediaeval cloister in
Rouen. No, this apocalyptic dance
could only be depicted by some ar-
tist who might have the power: to
do with a brush what I’ once heard
Edward R. Murrow do with words
over the radio as he described the
night bombing of Berlin from_one
of -the partici ating planes. No
place there for human personali-
ties; only a bright flash followed
by a long stench.

Food Packing
I arrived at the May Day Room
in Goodhart. It was flooded with

a bright light. From one end to
the other ran long tables for pack-
ing, sealing, tying the parcels.
Neatly on a-desk at one end were
piled the many various tags nec-
essary for mailing. Along one side
were ‘trunks and cases of clothing
and food: Pablum, Dextri-Maltose,
Hemo, dehydrated carrots, et¢., etc.,
etc, On the wall were large post-
ers describing the method to be fol-
lowed in packing and sealing: the
boxes. There was a sample food
box already packed and several
clothing boxes neatly tied and
stacked. The next day, the newly
returned veteran now clerking at
the Post Office told me that the
Br:n Mawr Relief packages were
the best packed he had seen). Some

tains a review of the Harvard Re-
port on Education, by Nancy
Morehouse. As a member of _ the
now defunct committee which pre-
pared the report, may I be permit-
ted to make some comments in re-

gates the Report, and her whip-
lashes are two: (a) the conclusions
of the Report are insignificant:
“the total effect remains that of a
mountain laboring to bring forth
a mouse,” (b) the Report is nebu-

Harvard Report _

The News gratefully acknowledges Professor Raphael
Demos’ answer to a review of the Harvard Report printed
in our last issue. Not only are we grateful for his interest
and kindliness, but for the opportunity to bring the whole



subject of the Harvard Report to the. minds of the under-

The importance of this Report must not be underestim-
ated whether or not its conclusions are accepted. With the
end of the war comes forth the opportunity to reconsider and
-expnad all educational programs. Not only have army exper-

-|iments brought certain methods of teaching into prominence,

but experiments carried on in universities in this country
have brought the whole problem of liberal arts education up
for reconsideration. Education is not a static thing. .New
courses, new methods, perhaps even new fundamental con-
cepts must continually be incorporated into a system designed
to accOmmodate a continually changing society. The under-
graduate’s concern in this problem is obviously a. vital one.
It is therefore essential that each and every undergraduate
consider the problem in all its aspects.

The Harvard Report itself has been placed on the Cur-
riculum Committee shelf in the Reserve Room. The Commit-
tee has also arranged to bring Dr. Benjamin Wright of Har-
vard to speak on “General Education in a Free Society.”
While no definite immediate action will be recommended by
the Committee on the basis.of the broader principles outlined
in the Harvard Report, such action may be forthcoming if the
students desire it. It is every undergraduate’s duty to ac-

aint herself thoroughly with the possibilities outlined in

You say that we get few inter-

have often made the same com-

tell you that, with the end of the

fewer. Positions that are not run-
of-the-mill are usually filled from
within an organization or through
a friend or by a fortunate inter-
view. I agree that we ought to do
more to ‘find them.

We went to the meeting called
for those interested in the future
of the Title. A spirit of intellec-

vailed which shocked and angered
those who attended with no pur-.
pose other than to advance con-
structive suggestions.

ors honestly wanted opinion. They
merely advanced a defense of their
activities and policies. We went in
a friendly mood genuinely inter-

‘ested in the welfare of the maga-

zine, because we felt that Bryn

zine, and also. that a good maga-
zine can be representative.

We consider ourselves represen-

good literature, even if our criteria

During the past few weeks,
there has been a great deal-of ‘dis-
cussion about the: value. of The
Title, both as a literary and as a
representative magazine, But_ it

this criticism, which has been con-
sistently overlooked, is that. crea-
tive writing is seriously neglected
at Bryn Mawr. Such writing is
merely tolerated as a side issue,
not treated as a subject in its own
right. Yet there are many students
who would welcome a. chance to
express themselves in other than
critical terms. Emphasis on crea-
tive as well as critical and analyti-
cal study would profit a_ liberal
arts major equally in all those
fields.

The-curriculum attempts to meet

full schedule. Therefore, instead of
being able to give such work the
especial care it requires, students
are forced by lack of time to hand
in writing which they know falls
depressingly short of what it
should be. Why are such courses
not counted as full units, and why
is more stress not placed on crea-
tive technique in the sie of lit-
erature? «/

It is these faults which are re-
sponsible for the lack of contribu-
tions to The Title. Creative work
is not encouraged for its own sake,
even though the evident interest in
a literary magazine shows that
the student body is eager for it.
We feel that college should pre-
pare students for life creatively
as well as critically, and in so doing
make fuller use of their potenti-
alities.

The recent “UNRRA” affair”, or
perhaps we should call it “fiasco”,
seems to crystallize in a concrete
issue the growing feeling of dis-
‘content which has been prevalent
“What is wrong with
Bryn Mawr?” people are asking
themselves. This restlessness seems
to be the product of academic iso-
lation from the world of reality.
In the past, it has unfortunately
“gripe”

cussion.

An: appeal was sent out. by the
UNRRA Personnel Division for
student workers to act'as messeng-
ers at the UNRRA Council meet-

ing in Atlantic City. This appeal.

was never announced openly to the
student body. It was left to the
discretion only of the social science
and language departments to offer

the opportunity to students whom,

they considered sufficiently strong
academically. These students were
to be allowed to absent themselves
from their ‘‘all-important” classes
for two weeks.

With the exception of one or two
of the faculty (names obtainable
on seals general announce-
ments were not made even in the
authorized departments. Accord-
ingly, many students who were
best qualified through their intel-
lectual and extra-curricular inter-
ests to take advantage of this ex-
perience, heard of the UNRRA ap-
peal only incidentally.

The lack of positive encourage-
ment from the college authorities,
their attitude of “Well, you can,go,
BUT ...!” seems strangely incon-
sistent with the policy of encoura-
ging individual student responsi-
bility to which the college pays
such devoted lip-service. What was
the result?—in spite of the earn-
est efforts of the Bureau of Rec-
ommendations there was a series
of delays against which the stu-
dents were powerless; meanwhile,
UNRRA had been flooded with ap-
plications from other sources and



had filled its quota, with the result



The allegation applies, though in a different sense, to|
Great Britain. High hopes were expressed, shortly after the
election of the Labor Government, that a new and construct-
ive interpretation of Britain's role would be developed.
Events have not borne out these expectations; such revision
as has been made in foreign policy has been conditioned by
the state of British trade and finance. Britain is devoting
her, efforts, not to creating an international scheme which
will permit and promote the free exchange of goods, the ba-
sis of a trading economy such as the British, but to the re-
establishment of her Vested interests, political and economic,
abroad and in the Empire.

The United States, likewise, has adopted a negative po-
sition in which the obstruction of others’ strong measures
seems to be the keynote. It is notable that Secretary Byrnes
said, “The United States intends to defend the charter’ of
the U.N.O., when the need is obviously for specific implemen-
tation of the charter’s aims. The food program is the one
bright spot on the horizon. If the development of a foreign
policy acceptable to all requires a policy of inaction, it would
be better to create opponents and produce a constructive pro-
gram.

The United States stands for democracy in the world
policy ; yet we know that democracy depends on soufid econ-
omic and social bases—the balanced economy, a firm yet
dynamic society. The development of industry in backward
countries, with its concomitant of internal and external
commercial expansion, is a specific program for which we can
work. At the same time a realistic yet constructive view of
political needs and aspirations must be achieved: we must
work toward the establishment of an adjustable international
order in which the advantages as well as the disadvantages
of a change are considered objectively, as far as this is pos-
sible. Only in this way can we hope to lay the specter of"

dents individually (a time-consum-
ing process) before expressing an
opinion as to whether they could
go without incurring permanent
damage academically speaking.

II. U.N.R.R.A. never at any

* Validity of Students’
: Criticisms

To the Editor:

I read with interest the unsigned
article concerning UNRRA which
appeared in the March thirteenth
issue of the College News.

If I may be frank, I think it
showed little thought and much
irrelevarit bad temper. As I take
it, the problem was the following:
UNRRA, in an emergency, needed
messengers; it has got them;
whether they are or are not Bryn
Mawr students seems to me beside
the point.

Moreover, I am surprised to find
that so many. college students
seein to consider themselves as oc-
cupied and available for any occu-
pation other than the one they are
engaged in. For to my mind a
college student has a full time job
for eight months of the year. ° It
is a privilege to be in college to-
day, a privilege which thousands

‘|of young men and women are will]-

ing to make great. sacrifices to
have. At is also a responsibility.
A wasted four years in college is
a big .waste. In any one year a
student has four months to herself
for her own activities; besides two
days every week during the other
eight. months. These give her am-
ple time to devote herself to
‘World issues”,

The “all important courses” are
what in part she is here to get.
What is the matter with Bryn
Mawr? Perhaps it is that too
many students are willing to re-
place their real responsibilities as
students to themselves and to “the
World” for pseudo-responsibilities
for. which “the World” is a good
excuse; perhaps it is also that they
are willing to substitute agitation
for real action of the kind they
undertake to put-through in four
years of college work. One of the
signs of breakdown in Germany
was the penpetual shifting of the
responsibility of students as stud-
ents in schools and universities, to
such activities as the winter drive
etc., the end result being a crop
of ignorant and intellectually ir-
responsible young men and women
with whom it is being found very
difficult to come to any construct-
ive understanding. I also do not
see what the opposition between
“Bryn Mawr” and the “outside
World” means. It seems to me,
to say the least, lacking in com-
mén sense and proportion. A uni-
versity is a part of the World in
which work is done which is a very
impontant part of human. activity.
In fact for four years, as never
again in their lives, students are
at the very center of what consti-

Accomodations Needed
For 1946 Graduation

And Junior Prom

To the Editors,

In considering the first post-war
graduation.at Bryn Mawr the very
practical preblem_ of accommoda-
tions for families and guests of
the seniors is immediately evident.
Reduced restrictions on travel, a
less exacting demand flor the time
of parents who were previously
engaged in war jproduction, and
the return of brothers and friends
who were iin the service means a
demand for accommodations which
far exceeds what the village can
supply. .

In addition, the graduation
program includes a return of the
traditional Junior Prom on_ the
Saturday before graduation. Ac-
commodatticns must |be provided
for the men who will be our guests.

Some figures may be given in
support of the demand which we
say exists. 54 seniors were poll-
ed; 38 of this number had not been
abe to obtain reservations for their
families for graduation.. They es-
timated their needs at rooms for
105. people.

In addition, some 20 seniors
needed -rooms for men for the
Junior Prom. It must be noted
that this figure does not include
the prom guests of the Juniors and
that only a few seniors have been
polled on this question.

It is our sugestion that serious
consideration be given to the use
of a hall for families. We also
suggest that Wyndham or the gym
be used to provide acconfmodations
for men for Saturday night,- June
8.

‘Student Seeks Reform}

Of Existing Campus

Organizations
To the Editor:

The campus “agitation” of last
week dealt with the “awakening”
of College life and the wider op-
portunity for the realization of ev-
ery kind of talent. This depends
upon ithe active and continuous
participation of each undergradu-
ate in-the activity in which she is
interested. Because these activities
are centered now in the 12 commit-
tees and 12 clubs of the 6 associa-
tions of the Undergraduate Coun-
cil, it seems difficult to do anything
constructive when working through
the many small groups that are
scattered along the gamut of un-
dergraduate organizations.

Proposed Reorganization

Therefore I propose a definite re-
organization of the Undergraduate
Association and a clarification of

the places of the clubs and com-

mittees as related to each other.
This plan involves 3 organizations
of the Undergraduate Council in-
stead of 6.

Service League

I. The first organization would

be a Service League—for service

“contact
Under
this League would function the

here and. abroad and for
with the outside world”.

Committee for Relief for Europe,
all the present Volunteer Social
United
War Stamps,

Nations
Debating
‘Club, International Relations Club
and the
Events

Organizations,
Council,

on Current
This

committee
and Assemblies.

League would then have to coord-.

inate and direct the work of 7 com-
mittees and 13 clubs now in the
Undergraduate Association.

Undergraduate Organization

II, The Undergraduate Organi-
zation would co-ordinate, but not
all the other
campus activities—Athletic Asso-
ciation, College News, Chapel,
Publicity, the five Academic Clubs,
Cut,
New Book Room, Entertainment,

necessarily direct,

the Curriculum, Vocational,
Subfreshman, Furniture Sales,
Maids Committee and the 9 clubs
which would function autonomous-
ly, and use each others members,
but might be regarded as under a
general Arts group—the Players
Radio, Chorus, Record Library,
Modern Dance, Dance, the Title,
Art and Camera Clubs.

Self-Government

III. Self-Government would stay
the same.

With the purpose and place of
every extra-curricular group clear-
ly defined, and allowing for indi-
vidual expression, then the stu-
dents ability to gain her ultimate
object in College life, and the best
development of her personality will
be directed through the clearest
channels and enable her to do more
and do it. better..

B. M. to Participate
In Poetry Contest’

A preliminary poetry competi-
Vtion has been announced by the
college to select the student who
will represent Bryn Mawr at an
intercollegiate poetry contest to be
held at ‘Mount Holyoke in May.
The winning poem will be read by
the author at the Mount Holyoke
contest, where it will be judged
by a group of authorities on poe-
try, with a $100 prize for the best
poem. ;

A faculty committee has been
appointed by Miss McBride com-
prising Mr. Cameron, Miss Staple-
ton, and Mrs. Foster to judge the
entries in the preliminary compe-
tition. Manuscripts should be left
in Miss Stapleton’s office not later
than April 16.

Group to Begin

Work on Drama

The aim of the Experimental
Drama Group is to work on plays
without the pressure of production.
It will concentrate on the develop-
ment of individual talent in the
fields of acting and _ direction.
There are no requirements for
membership, and the Group is op-
ened to anyone interested in join-
ing.

Any group of people may work
on a play of their own choosing,
either an original work or one that
is already familiar. In ‘this way
several, differente plays may be
worked on simultaneously.

Plans are being made to start
work on Chekov’s “Seagull” right
after vacation. There has already
been a preliminary reading of the
play, and tryouts will be held later.

As yet, the group has not become
fwlly organized, Any suggestions
will be greatly appreciated. A sug-
gestion box will be placed in Tay-
lor.

A few days ago Billy Rose, the
well known promoter of show-
girls, made a public statement to
the effect that “beautiful girls
don’t go to college.” .. The Harvard
Lampoon took exception to this ob-
vious fallacy and sent a telegram
to Mr. Rose,. challenging him to a
beauty contest,between six of his
girls and an equal number of col-
lege girls—to be chosen by the
Lampoon. (Mr. Rose has accepted
our challenge, and we are hoping
for your help in selecting the girls
to compete against his group.

The contest is to be held in Cam-
bridge on Saturday afternoon, the
eighteenth of May. The girls are
to appear? in evening gowns and
bathing suits. Th Judges are to
be five prominent newspapermen,
plus a representative from the
A. P. and one from the U. P. The
evening gowns and bathing suits
are to be designed, individually, by
Adrian, a famous designer, who
has offered his services free of
charge. As you can see, this con-
test will offer an excellent oppor-
tunity for girls interested in the
theatre and modeling. We feel
that it is our duty to further the
interests and uphold the honor of
the American_college-womanhood.
No public spirited collegian will
disagree with this!

We are asking you to select, by
‘whatsoever means you prefer (a
college-wide poll is suggested),
the two most beautiful girls in
your college. It is our intention
to hold a preliminary contest at the
Hasty Pudding Club on Saturday,
the eleventh of May. It is then
that we will select the six girls that
will compete against Mr. Rose’s
girls. After the contest the Lam-
poon will give a dance for the
girls competing in the preliminary
contest. Adrian will be present
so that he may design the dresses
for the winners.

We sincerely hope that you will
cooperate with us in this effort.

Sincerely,
Arnold W. Morse

The Harvard Lampoon

has offered the use of its ballroom

be on hand to give the college girls
final suggestions and coaching.

to postpone its journey to Wash-

The Committee received replies
in the affirmative from all colleges
except Hunter, from which nothing

of the United States Students As-

proposed that the food program be
madg a topic for discussion at the
U.S.S.A. meeting in New York this

send a delegate to explain the ac-

Harvard also pledged support
through their college branches of
the American Veterans Committee.

_A letter is following the tele-

measures for adoption by the gov-

To the Editor:,

A friend..of~mine. was. talking
about musical prodigies this week-

old boogie-woogie wonder who has

of a young girl who while recog-
nized as a magnificent pianist had
not been allowed to give many per-
formances, Much to my astonish-

who is playing here Monday.

She is playing at a reduced rate,

Part of the S. S. A. program is
to serve American students by
making them sensitive to our gen-

formed of the life of students in
other parts of the world, and
aware of the crisis in universities
abroad and of its meaning for stud-

Since the new food program has
been adopted at Bryn Mawr, we
have not noticed as marked a cut-
down in the amount of vital foods
served as we expected. We are get-
ting-more fruit-and vegetables for
wheat, sugar, and fat products,
but not to the extent we had ex-
pected. We feel that we could still
get along without cake for dessert
and without such things as marsh-
mallow sauce to make up for the
sugar we skip at breakfast. We
here suggest that more people
should see Miss Bacheller about
planning the menus, or at least
make themselves heard around
campus, for if there is enough ac-
tive support of the feod program
by the students we believe its ef-
fect on our menus will be more
marked.

We would also like to see a re-
port from the food committee that
they have received. sugar, wheat,
and oil from the college, as there
is still some doubt in our minds as
to exactly what is being done with
the food saved.

Franco in our favor.

Definite Policy

With the end of the war, it is of the utmost importance
that the United Nations take a definite. stand on. their rela-
tions with Spain. Recently there has been increasing proof
that Franco had definite Axis sympathies, and while he may
not represent an actual threat to international peace, his re-
gime is obviously incompatible with the existence of demo-
cratic governments. Now that there is no longer the. threat
of Axis domination, the time has come to deal forciblywith
the only remaining fascist power in Europe, but instead we
have made only mild, non-committal-statements. Careful
consideratioii must, of course, be given to the fact thd§' the
United Nations may be charged with intervention in the do-

mestic-affairs of a sovereign state, and that a civil war or

nationalist reaction might follow the fall of Franco.

‘

Thorough Investigation

Certainly the issue has been complicated by the reluctance
of Great Britain to disturb the status quo, and by the prob-
lem of the government which should succeed Franco. But it
goes far deeper than the problem of the existence of such a
regime, it represents a challenge to the unity and efficiency

of the U.N. O. We hope that after a thorough investigation
of the situation and the measures which should be adopted,

the results will be translated into direct action. The United
Nations cannot afford to sacrifice the democratic bases on

which its future success must depend.

Historical Sketches

By Katrina Thomas ’49

“If you give young women self-
government’ Bryn Mawr- will ~be
closed within six months,” prophe-
sied ex-president Eliot of Harvard
in 1892, when the first self-govern-
ment in a women’s college was
founded at Bryn Mawr...Since that
time the association has suffered
resignations and almost death over
the question of reporting one’s
friends, but has weathered fifty-
four years and is still going strong.
Since its foundation, manners and
morals have changed throughout

t| the world and the rules and regula-

tions of the association reflect
these changes.

In the ’90s, no one would have
dreamed of showing her ankles,
but by 1905 there had to be a rule
that stockings might not be worn
rolled down, No men were allowed
at the plays because some of the
actresses would be wearing: trous-
ers. Finally in 1917 a motion was
unanimously passed admitting men
to class plays in the gym, but was.
Kimited by a clause that they must
sit on the ground floor and that
students must not hang their feet
over the gallery on such occasions..

In 1905 it is noted that Bryn
Mawr was among the more liberal
colleges, being one of the few which
had no 10 o’clock rule for lights
out, no compulsory chapel, and in
having the regulations for ab-
sences under the students. These
absences were strictly chaperoned
and in ’16 the chaperone rules
were broadened to include a broth-
er over 18:as a suitable chaperone,
if there were other men along!

Social engagements with the
faculty were forbidden till 1917
and then allowed only with women
and married men, because it was
desirable to have “ a slightly for-
mal” but “not strained” relation-
ship between faculty and students.
The same year students were al-
lowed to return from town un-
chaperoned not later than the lo-
cal which left at 7:45 on week-
days, and it was safe to return
half an hour later on Sundays.

In the early ’20s most of the us-
ual self-government fines and let-
ters of warning were inflicted on
girls who did not obey the chaper-
one rules or who wore “bloomers’”
or “knickers” in Taylor and the
library. ‘Four girls were fined for
playing cards for money. Later
the chief problem was smoking, al-
though as early as 1915 four girls.
were severely reprimanded for
smoking “eubebs” despite their.
medicinal nature. Students could
only smoke in private houses with-
in a 25-mile radius if they were
spending the night. Finally in De-.
cember 1925 considerable agitation
caused Bryn Mawr to lead the oth-.
er women’s colleges in adopting
regulations allowing smoking on.

One could not read the article
“Bedlam 1946” in the May 6, 1946
issue of Life magazine without
shuddering to think that such con-
ditions of degradation, filth, and
inhumanity are in existence with-
in a few miles of Bryn Mawr Col-
lege. It%s almost incomprehens-
ible that through public neglect
and legislative penny-pinching the
State of Pennsylvania has allowed
its institutions for the care and
cure of the mentally sick to de-
generate into. little more than con-
centration camps of the Belsen
pattern. :

Surely it is up to the student
body to make some sort of united
protest (perhaps under the lead-
ership of the Bryn Mawr League)
to the State Legislature—either
through petitions or through let-
ters. If enough feeling could be
aroused perhaps the college auth-
orities themselves might be will-
ing to take some stand on the is-
sue,

In any case, let us not sit here
in dignified complacency.

Dean Taylor Describes
Plan for Exchanging
Foreign Students

To the Edixor: |

The conference on the interna-
tional exchange of, students, held
at Chicago from April 29 to May
1, was called by the Institute of
International Education at the re-
quest of the State Department’s
Office of International Information
and Cultural Affairs. It was attend-
ed by several members of that
office and of the Office of Educa-
tion, by representatives of France,
Poland, Czecho-Slovakia, Egypt
and China, by members of the Fa-
culty and Administration of 103
colleges and universities from ev-
ery section of this country and by
delegates from some twenty-five
private agencies interested in the
exchange of students.

The conference had been well
planned. The: speeches were brief
and the. discussion, in which-many
delegates took part, was interest-
ing and in general to the point.
It was illuminating for those of
us who have been overwhelmed by
applications. of foreign students
for admission to smaller institu-
tions to realize how much greater
the problem is for the large uni-.
versities. There was a heartening
unanimity of view that the inter-
national exchange of. students is
an—important—contribution to mu-
tual understanding between na-
tions. <:

Wide opportunities for Ameri-

pean students to study abroad will,

it is hoped, be available in the
future. These opportunities would
be increased by the passage of the
Fulbright bill which would permit
the use for scholarships of funds
received for sale of surplus prop-
erty abroad: At present Switzer-
land, Sweden and various Latin-
American countries are ready to
receive students. France and Pol-
and have lately announced that
they will accept in 1946-47 re-
spectively twenty-five and_ fifteen
students on exchange scholarships.

The United States is, however,
at the present time the most fav-
orable place for the meeting of
students of various nationalities.
It was encouraging to learn that
even the most crowded institutions
are ready to open their doors to
as many foreign students as pos-
sible, though a large proportion of
the estimated 50,000 asking for
admission will have to be refused.
Some will be diverted from the
larger institutions, whose names
best known: abroad, to smaller
places, and many of the students
who come will have to put up with
crowded living conditions. That
they have shown themselves ready
to do.

development of exchange of stu-
dents with Russia, but so far ef-
forts to work out a program have:
been unsuccessful. Numerous.



scholarships for Russian students.
would, it was reported, be avail-
able, and many of our students.
wish to go to Russia.

There was also discussion of ex-
change of students with “enemy”
countries. Some Italian students.
and possibly some Austrian may
be expected next year, but there
seemed to be no immediate pros-
pect of having either German or
Japanese students. One representa--

In. view of the editorial in last
week’s News, I feel it would be
valuable to clarify the position of
the Chapel Committee in regards
to the Sunday Evening Services.

The problem of attendance has
naturally been uppermost in our
minds this year. It is obvious that
the service as it now stands does
not meet the needs of the majority
of the campus; the work of the
Committee has» been directed
toward the investigation of this
campus feeling. The Committee
agrees most heartily with the Edi-
torial Board of the News that the
service should be undenomination-
al; it also feels that there should
be more religio-ethical lectures and
increasing opportunity for discus-
sion in groups.

One of the main reasons for pla-
cing the Chapel Committee under
the Undergraduate Association was
to insure the widening of its scope
to include such lectures as those
given recently by Father Coleman,
Dr. Calhoun, etc. We feel these
lectures and discussions to be. very
important; the Sunday Evening
Services, however, are usually fol-
lowed by stimulating and all too
sparsely attended discussions.

It is the carefully studied opin-
ion of the Chapel Committee that
the lectures and discussions, while
valuable in the intellectual ‘sense,
have no spiritual significance and,
therefore, in no way take the place
of the Worship Service.

We would be very interested in
working with members of the Col-
lege Community in compiling a
form of worship which would have
more substance and yet would re-
main undenominational. The most
important function of the Commit-
tee is its representation . of the
Campus Concern.

Historical Sketches

The origin of Undergrad is
shrouded~—in—mystery, although
some claim that it was the second
organization on campus. Absolute-
ly no one knows the date of its
beginning. A “Hand-Book” pub-
lished in 1900 shows that there was
the Undergraduate Association on
campus at that time and that its
aim was “to represent the students
to the President and Faculty.” This
idea is embodied in the present

slogan, “coordination and represen-

dinates all activities on campus

Academic Freedom

The intervention of government administrators who



have taken over six Argentine universities is in direct oppo-
sition to the ideals of a democratic way of life. The privilege
of a professor to teach what he wishes in his own way is a
fundamental part of general education in a free society.
Government control of teaching in universities cannot be tol-
erated without leading to dictatorship and a form of nation-
alistic education against which the United Nations have
fought.

The resignation of professors and the active protests of
students in Argentina against “the subordinating of teach-
ing to a political ideology in the German or Italian manner”
is representative of a group which is willing to fight for what
it knows is right. As long as there are governments which
will attempt education control, peace aims cannot be secure.

If parents are permitted to ex-
press opinions,..I..should like to
voice mine regarding “Chapel Re-
form” in the May 8th issue.

The Editorial presents the prob-
lem very fairly and the suggested
change seems sound—but—the Ed-
itorial seems to reflect the present
theoretical attitude towards relig-
ion, relegating the Divine spirit to
“an integral part of American cul-
ture.”

Do you suppose it was religion,
as it related to Belgian culture,
which took Father Damicu to serve
and die with the lepers at Molokai;
er Greek Culture which produced
the unconquerable and incompara-
ble St. Paul; or Kentucky and II-
linois culture which gave to Abra-
ham Lincoln his strength and mer-
ey? I don’t think so.

Religion is a way of life, a living
force, a great companionship, and
through it comes undiscouragable
hope, great service and triumphant
character.

Yours sincerely,
Elisabeth T. Babcock

Every senior who must take an
oral this fall-realizes that a great
deal depends on the result. A
failure certainly means that she
will not be granted her degree this
June, and cannot receive it until
next June. A failure may mean a
considerable change in her future,
especially if she had planned to
enter graduate school.

For this reason, it seems unfair
to ask thesé seniors to wait any
longer than necessary: before the
results are announced., The mini-
mum time to date has been two
days—from Saturday to Monday.
It is improbable that this. period
could ever be shortened. A wait
of four days, however, is inexpli-
cable and cruel, in view of the
extra strain placed on these stu-
dents. If a shorter waiting
had_not.been shown f

éd time would not be so wear-
ing. If the announcement of the

“A good many mistakes have
been made by the Labor Govern-
ment, but a great deal of progress
has also been made,” stated Miss
Caroline Robbins, in a talk on vari-
ous aspects of the socialist: govern-
iment. in Britain. “The whole com-
‘plexion of things is different.”

One of the strongest impressions
that Miss Robbins received on her
recent visit to England was of “the
feebleness of the opposition” being
put up by the Tories in Parliament
to the various policies of the Labor
Party. Even on the subject of
finance, which was expected to be
a Tory strong point, the addresses
have been weak, although there
has been ample opportunity for
criticism. One of the reasons for
this is the fact that during the war
the Tory government itself insti-
tuted many™ policies of a rather
socialistic nature, and this makes
criticism difficult.

The Labor party, on the ser
hand, has already formulated ex-
tensive plans for the next election.
Their plan for the socialization of
England will take 15 years to
carry to completion, but the gov-
ernment is trying to proceed as
rapidly as possible in case their
hopes for reelection fail.

The present government is at-
tempting to preserve the personal
liberties of the populace, but some
infringements have of course been
made. A huge number of acts

Ten o’clock; the bell rings and
there is a great closing of books
and putting on of coats. We trot
home across the paths. Taylor
tips his copper-green wizard’s hat
and the faces on the lamp-globes
shine down with patronizing grins.
The windows of the halls stream
light brashly and somehow com-

long ceremony of getting to bed.
Immediately upon entering the
hall, it becomes imperative to
smoke ‘a cigarette, or play a hand

newspaper, or make a telephone
call, or buy something at the book-
shop, or do anything else equally
unnecessary but pleasurable.

Finally we go upstairs and
laboriously get undressed. Then
begins the ritual of the so-called
snack. The corridors become alive
with people and milk, people and
soup, people and cocoa, people
with matches, and people seeking
to borrow. matches, people, in
a word, with the fixed look
of nocturnal appetite. And so we
cook and eat, and eat and talk.
Everything slows down to a gentle
tempo of tired animality because
we know ourselves to be much too
tired to work any more, to be, in
fact, so tired that it is impossible
to go to bed.

For now we must have a bath.
We forget first the towel and then
the soap. We talk to the other
bathers in long drowned. sentences
of great solemnity and wit. And
then, so tired and foolish are we,
that we must comb our hair four
different ways, clean our shoes, and.
poke at the accumulated clutter of
papers and clothes upon desks and
chairs, until finally we troop down-
stairs for one last cigarette and
the fit of laughter which invariably
seems to overcome everyone in the

Nineteen years old, Suetze Li
came to America two years ago.
She lived in Shanghai until it was
occupied and then moved ‘to Hong
Kong. Three months later Peart
Harbor occurred, and with the sub-
sequent collapse of Hong Kong, the
family moved once again to the
war capital, Chungking. During
her two and one-half years there,
Suetze had a tutor because most
of the schools were extinct. All
the good schools and universities,
being located on the coast of
Chjna, were immediately occupied
by the Japanese. They moved in-
land as best they could, the stud-
ents carrying the equipment on
their hacks, but they lacked books,
and teachers, and were bombed.
When Suetze had a chance to come
to America, she did, entering the
Baldwin School. She wants to re-
turn to China before she gradu-
ates. “After six years,” she says,
“T’ll be a foreigner there myself.”
She hopes to get her A. B. from
Bryn Mawr in science because
“that is what they need most in
China.”

Signe Ihlen-claims that it is very
usual for Norwegians to want to
come to America. “American col-

best,” she says, and so she arrived
six weeks ago on a boat with 100
other students, mostly boys. Signe
did not have the idea of coming to
America until last February even
though her father had attended the
University of Massachusetts. “A
sort of America fever was going
on at home,” she claims. A Jun-
ior, Signe ‘wants to learn lan-
guages and to major in Politics.
Although she wants to return to
Norway this summer, she would
like to stay in America for a few
years after graduation and get a
political job, preferably with the

I would like to try to clarify
some misunderstandings which
resulted from the hall meetings
held: by the Curriculum Committee .
last week. .

The Curriculum Committee, rep-
resenting the student body,
brought to the attention of the
Faculty Scheduling Committee
that a majority of students wish-
ed to have the Thanksgiving week-
end as a vacation. The faculty
pointed out that the schedule was
drawn up and printed last Febru-
ary as usual, upon full considera-
tion of the previous petition, and
the students should have present-
ed their views at that time or at a
regular faculty meeting after the
schedule appeared.

Last minute petitioning is indic-
ative of insufficient planning on
our part. The responsibility lies
with the whole undergraduate
body which must request any ac-
tion which the curriculum commit-
tee may take.

The holiday granted last year
was a victory celebration and was
not to be .considered as setting a -
precedent.

The arguments presented by the
Curriculum ‘Committee to the hall
meetings were not their own. They
included those which the faculty
had given in a combined meeting,
for it was felt that they should be
stated to the undergraduate body
in order to insure understanding
of both sides of the question.

Historical Sketches

By Katrina Thomas, ’49

Bryn Mawr was not affected by
man-power shortages before 1929.
In fact, men never attended dances
before that year. In the “Good
Old Days,” the undergraduate
body got all rigged up in their
newest finery, sent éach other. cor-
sages and went off to danee with
one another.

A typical event was that of 1922.
“Sophomores ,Give Most Brilliant
Dance on Record”, read the head-
lines in the News. This “brilliant”
affair to receive the Freshmen was
a combination of food, skits and
dancing in the setting of “a pal-
ace of ice” in the gym. It ended
promptly at 10 o’clock, at which
timé all good girls are supposed
to be in bed, and so at that time
the \Freshmen reluctantly tore
themselves away from their dash-
ing. Sophomore escorts.

It is rumored that the Senior
class of ’20, rueing the manless
state of affairs, invited a few men
to a dance following their ‘Garden
Party. Allowing no time for a
reply previous to the gala event,
they cabled President Thomas who
was on her trip around the world
(at that moment motoring through —
{the Peloponesus), asking permis-
sion to have a mixed dance. They
then proceeded to hold their jam-
boree — with men — on Merion
Green.

However, there is no verification
for the above tale and the inaug-
urators of a tea dance in ’29 really
believed that a dance with men
had never before been held at
Bryn Mawr. This event, held
from 4 to 7 before the Varsity
Play, was te be of “a mild and in-
formal character” with a substan-

Value of International
Assembly Stressed
‘By Lograsso

To the Editor:

It seems unfortunate to me that
the College News account of the
recent meeting of delegates from
Assembly for
Women with students and faculty
at the Deanery failed to stress cer-
tain common fundamental points in
the short speeches made by the
various delegates.

Desire for World Freedom

All of the speakers (with thé
possible exception of the delegate
from Sweden) gave expression to
the longing for liberty among the
peoples they represented. We who
listened felt that these delegates,
most of whom had experienced di-
rectly the terror of tyrann (some

had been confined to pri§on or-in_

concentration camps;/ some had
known first-hand the scourge of
war;/others had beer active in re-
sistance movembts)/ were giving
testimony. to-the desire for freedom
and democracy the world over. .
Surely this o4nnot be a matter
of indifference to us Americans.. It
ought to give us the courage to
demand from our leaders a fer-

will encourage democratic move-

The terrific impact accompany-
ing the dropping of the atomic
bombs over Japan, and the wide
and revolutionary implications of
atomic energy as a whole seem to
have slipped into the background
in recent months Human nature
is a funny thing, and people seem
to think that problems as grave
as this can be solved more easily
by simply avoiding them and for-
getting about them, than by keep-
ing them constantly in mind and
actually working them out We do
not say. that everybody has for-
gotten—that is no more true than
to say that nobody has forgotten.
But unfortunately, too many other-
wise intelligent people are neglect-
ing their obligations to be con-
scious of the gravity of the prob-
lem of atomic’ energy. World-
consciousness, political, economic
and social-awareness today, de-
mands awareness of the implica-
tions of atomic energy. It is a
factor vital to each of our lives
and we owe it to ourselves and to
the future to be thinking about it

now. *

For these reasons, therefore, we
want to organize an intercollegi-
ate committee to formulate and
carry through educational pro-
grams. in every field touched by
atomic energy. On Saturday, No-
vember 9, a meeting was held at
the University of Pennsylvania,
under the auspices of the Associa-
tion of Philadelphia Scientists, the
‘|purpose of which was to organize
the huge student population in the
Philadelphia area and to discuss
plans as mentioned above. These
programs will include forums, de-
bates, films and discussions led by
outstanding authorities in the
fields of economics, politics, soci-
ology and science. But we cannot
get anywhere with our plans un-
less we have the full support of
our student body. What does Bryn

Limit of Two Tickets
For Commencement

Deplored
To the Editor:

While we realize that this may
not be considered the most appro-
priate time at which to criticize a
college policy toward the alumnae,
it is our opinion that the Com-
mencement problem deserves
prompt attention. It is not fair
to restrict the Seniors to two tick-
ets each. If there is one day in
the four years that we attend Bryn
Mawr that belongs to the Senior
Class and the graduate students
receiving degrees, it is Commence-
ment. For us, our family and
friends, it represents one on the
bigger milestones that we pass; it
is the end, for the majority, of
formal schooling and the passing,
to use a cliche, “over the Alps into
Italy.”

By limiting us to two seats
apiece, the College is, in effect,
prohibiting the presence of any
members of our family other than
our parents. To take from us the
seats that might go to our broth-
ers, sisters, or other relations, in



‘order to give them to the alumnae

who are “reuning” is not only un-

‘just but is poor policy. We are

The League wishes to express
agreement with the News editorial
concerning the student apathy to-
ward extra-curricular activities.
Speaking for the League Board,

| we feel that those few people who

participate should be given due
credit for their work. On the other
hand, we also feel that the major-

y of people on campus show a
remarkable lack of interest in ser-
ious community work. This lack
of interest is illustrated in two
ways.

In the first place, many people,
especially the upperclassmen, are
so apathetic that they do not make
responsibility. Secondly, several
of those who unteered—do.. not
realize that the community is de-
pending on them. The students in
charge of Red Cross activities of-
ten find that those who have vol-
unteered are unwilling to appear
for the actual work. Also, during
the Freshman Hall plays it was
practically impossible to get sub-
stitutes from the other classes to
read at the Blind School.

We realize that the regularity of
the work and the transportation
difficulties present problems, but
those who have shown interest
prove that these difficulties can be
overcome. The League cannot op-
erate in a vacuum. It needs the
support of the student body.

Helen Poland
President of the Bryn Mawr League

Alliance Angles

While the Alliance can hardly

-|sit back on its haunches and view

its “works” with complete satis-
faction, it does feel that the edi-
torial in the News last week was
a little’ too strong in its attack on
dwindling enthusiasm.

The Heads of Activities agree
that on the whole students have
maintained their interest as is
shown, for example, in, usually
large attendance of Current
Events, and the even attendance of
IRC. The Debate Club has start-



ocoann the nations today. This slimes aind has led:
in some quarters to‘distrust of the intentions of the princi-
pal powers, notably the United States and Russia. Much of
this distrust can be allayed by carrying out the action sug-
gested in the petitions.

It is not so obvious to the Russians as it may be to our-
selves that the United States is not harboring any aggressive
inclinations involving the use of the atomic bomb. If the
United States ceases production of atomic weapons and de-
stroys those it now has in stock, this should offer fairly con-
clusive proof of our peaceful intentions.
to such an action ,would be indicative not only of her own
aims, but of the success which may be hoped for in an inter-
national program of atomic control and development.

It is clear to all those who nave done some serious think-
ing on the problem that atomic energy cannot be “undiscov-
ered.” Since this development cannot possibly be stifled, the
only course open to us is to direct its further advance into
peaceful fields and away from its destructive aspects. An
Atomic Development Authority, such as is proposed in the
Acheson-Lilienthal Report, answers the need for an inter-
national agency solely authorized and equipped to conduct the
basic operations in the production of atomic energy. By its
unique control of atomic energy.any authorized production

LAST NIGHTERS

Cocteau’s Play Suffers
From Bad Translation;

Bankhead is Superb |
by Barbara Bettman ’49

Somehow it is difficult to justify
a French playwright who in 1947
writes an eighteenth century ro-
mance, and this is what Jean Coc-
teau has done in the new play at
the Forrest, “The Eagle Has Two
Heads.” Mr. Cocteau’s two heads
in this case are Tallulah Bankhead
and Helmut Dantine, without whom
the eagle could never have launch-
ed what I imagine will be its rath-
er short-lived flight.

The plot involves Miss Bankhead
as.Queen of a somewhat nebulous
state; her hisband having been
assassinated on their wedding day,

_|she has lived with his ghost’for ten

years. The young revolutionary
who @# sent to kill her on the tenth
anniversary of the king’s death,
bears an incredible resemblance to
the king—and now to go on with
the story. The Queen announces
in her twenty-minute soliloquy
(which should soon equal in notor-
iety that speech of Mr. Eugene
O’Neil’s principal character in his
current Broadway experiment) that
she intends to make her life a trag-
edy; this she achieves successfully
in one of the longest, least grace-
ful, and most talkative death scenes
ever brought to the theatre,

Play Successful Abroad

“The Eagle Has Two Heads” was
highly successful in Paris. One is
led to believe that the translation
may be at fault, and this belief is
strengthened by such anachronisms
as “running bogrd” and an ex-
tremely jazzy trumpet fanfare.
Translationese runs rampant; the
predicate adjective always precedes
the subject; and-such efforts at
Oscar Wilde for the masses as “A
little love is part death ‘but'a great
love is suicide” are uncomfortable.
It might be well to note also here
that the use of the word “bitch”
has become so overworked as to
have no meaning except a still un-
pleasant sound.

Bankhead Superb

Tallulah herself is magnificent.
however; her presence is as com-
pelling as that of anyone on the
‘American stage today, and she is
admirably suited to the role of
queen. She seems convinced of
her unconvincing part and hers is
the voice for the few beautiful
lines of the play. Dantine is an ex-
cellent Stanislas, who came to kill
but remained to love, and the sup-
porting characters are good, their
super-dramatics no doubt justified
by the super-dramatism of the
play. Donald Oenslager’s sets are
| handsome, and Aline Bernstein’s
costumes likewise, But “The Eagle
Has Two Heads” is another play
to be added to the long list of this
season’s offerings whose actors are
too good for their vehicle and whose
authors have turned out plays far
below their usual standards.

I was amused at the article in
last week’s News on “The Eagie
Has Two Heads,” and I have a
strong suspicion that Cocteau
himself would have enjoyed it
greatly. He announces: “A Ro-
mantic Melodrama.” And so it is.
A storm (of course); a castle (of
course); a queen (indispensable) ;
a poet (anyone would guess that).
And the villain? Ah yes, the vil-
lain, an arch-villain, an  arche-
duchesse. And that is all the fun.
The author does not miss a trick;
in fact he calls them—“what a fine
curtain scene!” says the Queen as
the intense hero-poet in a moment
of blacker revolt than usual rises,
dragging to the floor the table-
cloth, the wine, and all that goes
with them. The parody is com-
plete, and so impertinent! The
poison so carefully described as
the type of poison that acts slow-
ly and in a peculiar way, allowing
the character, up to the very last
moment, to get in all his speeches
in good order. “Well,” says the
Queen, “‘the second act was not so
bad, but wait till you see the
third”—or words to that effect.

No wonder Paris and London
were amused; and any theatre-
lover will be amused as he recog-
nizes, in. the gay caricature, the
face of an old friend, the romantic
melodrama; and he laughs at. the
impertinence of the author who is
quietly thumbing his nose at the
too, too earnest play-goer. The
play is well worth going to see for
the two hours of somewhat subtle
fun and humour we get out of it,
but it is scarcely worth a full and
serious column of the Bryn Mawr
College News. And as we leave
it we give-a thought to the future
author who a hundred years from
now will gently poke fun at our
own type of intense melodrama;
who knows, at our Anna Lucastas,
for example.

being entirely neglected. Hockey,

idealistic ravings, and Phil’s_ in-
cessant self-debasement.

One could allow this trite, tried
and tested flot to pass without
comment, for a real situation was
being exposed, but the unreality
with which it was presented was
the thing at fault. Phil and Kathy,
“the boy and girl,’ never come
alive at all. A series of cliches
does not constitute reality. It does
jar the audience to a point almost
beyond belief. When Phil calls on
the phone, Kathy’s dewy-voiced
“Hello there yourself” is calculat-
ed to make most audiences wince.
This audience audibly groaned.
When Phil appeared he looked and
acted more like a gangly fifteen
year old than a war veteran. To
an adolescent youth Kathy’s sug-
gestion that they drink a “coke”
might have been appealing. But
if Phil was anything like he-said
he was, Kathy should have shed
her idealism just long’ enough to
offer him a good stiff highball.

The exposition of the play was
fairly well handled. The develop-
ment was vaguely discernible. The
production was utterly ruined by
the unreality of Kathy’s and Phil’s
characterizations. Phil was the “I
am unworthy of you, kick me twice
around the block” kind of charac-
ter who walked out on his girl.
Then she knew that underneath it
all he simply was NOT what he
said he was. I do not believe that
real people in a similar situation
would say the things that these
two said to each other. The epi-
sode sounded forced, and the act-
ing. was even more so. Ted Wright
as Phil, was miscast. No more
need be said on that count.

might be made into a competent,
unoriginal, one-acter. As it stands
now it does not reveal the writer’s
talents."

Every year the problem of at-
tendance at Chapel arises. There
is no better time than the begin-
ning of a new year to do some 2on-
structive thinking about it.

All of us, while we are at Col-
lege, do a lot of thinking about
who we are, how we will build a
happy life, and, ultimately, What-
It’s-All-About. And it is not ir-
relevant to note that 1) college
students do not go to church sim-
ply because it is socially correct
and 2) sincere interest in religion
as an aid in answering those ques-
tions is not, as it apparently was
20 years ago when the Bryn Mawr
Christian Association was officially
disbanded,  preposterously  old-
fashioned and un-realistic.

We have access to a College ap-
propriation for Religious Life
which enables us to have at our

services as. fine speakers as we ran’

find. And the Chorus gives us
good music.
one feels that the average congre-
gation is rather pitiful, certainly
out of proportion to our resources.

The conclusion seems to be that
the present Chapel service does
not meet what need, if any, is felt
by Bryn Mawr students to seek
help of a religious nature.

1) Do you think that our service
at its best, with the discussion
after it, is adequate to the needs

Yet each year every- |

On Services

of the Campus?

2) Is there a need for opportu-
nity to think about religion and/
or to-worship that is not met eith-

lege courses and the present Chaz-
el service?

3) How do you think we can use
our’ considerable resources to bet-
ter advantage in meeting the re-
ligious needs of a very heterogen-
eous group of people?

We shall, during the first semes-
ter, try to answer the first ques-
tion by trying hard really to pre-
sent the traditional Chapel serv-
ice at its best—having an out-
standing list of speakers, making
the service itself as pleasing and
effective as possible, and improv-
ing on the length and, if possible,
the coherence of the discussions.
One student-conducted service will
indicate, but by no means conclu-
sively, your reception of the Chap-
‘el service without a sermon,

I ask you please 1) to deal kind-
ly with our attempt to give the
present service a good trial; 2) te
think hard and out-loud “about the
second question; and 8) if your
answer is affirmative, to criticise
constructively, so that we may
make positive changes during the
second semester.

Sincerely;
Elizabeth McClure, ’48,
Head of Chapel for 1947-1948."

cn1947-10-15.txt,['To the Editor:'],"

Of all the criticism currently to
be heard on the subject of Chapel,
the most frequent is. that it should
be held in a more appropriate
place. Certainly this is true: the
Music Room cannot be transformed
into a place for formal worship
simply by hiding the blackboard.
It~is not so ugly, though, and not
so uncomfortable that it could not
be a place of worship if the service
were changed to suit the place.

The Music Room is not, I think,
the real obstacle. The service it-
self does not fit the needs of the
college. Chapel, as it exists, is not
satisfactory for anyone, least of
all the congregation. Those stu-
dents who enjoy a formal service
go to church on Sunday morning.
They will not go to a formal serv-
ice again on Sunday evening, espe-
cially one held in so incongrous a
place. The people who don’t go to
church in the morning will, for the
same reasons, not go to chapel in
the evening.

Worship Service

The need is, I think, for a serv-
ice without the formality of a
church service. My proposition is
that we change the service into a
service for worship, that we sub-
tract from the intellectual element
and add to the spiritual. Instead
ofa service centered around the
minister and his sermon, I suggest
that chapel|be led by a member of
the Chapel Committee and that it
consist of music, both by choir and

congregation, prayers said by all,
the reading of a passage of the
Bible, and five minutes or so of
quiet. Such a service would give

-to all the very necessary sense of

spiritual relaxation -which we so
much need to counteract the intel-
lectual feverishness of our week-
day lives.
“Speakers

I realize that the great objection
to this plan is that it deprives us
of so many excellent speakers; it
need not. The same men could
come under different — and more
favorable—circumstances. Ae it
is, they must speak within the tra-
ditional limits of the sermon; they.
are tired, having spoken to anoth-
er congregation that morning;
they have, often, a long trip home
ahead of them. The discussions
are limited by weariness and lack
of time and our reticence when
confronted with a man in robes
who has just given a sermon. Why
not have these speakers come dur-
ing the week, when they have more
time and will, surely, have larger
audiences? Why not have them
give talks rather than sermons, so
that they will be freer to speak
and we to question? Such talks
and discussions would fit in with
the lectures given by members ef
other faiths and they would supply
the intellectual half of our relig-
ious life as chapel would the pure-
ly spiritual.

political beliefs, or economic cir-
cumstances. These aims will be
pursued on the national, regional
and campus level through such ac-
tivities as-collecting and dissem-
inating information and statistics,
working out student tours and cul-
tural exchanges, and bringing stud-
ents together to discuss and plan
projects for the improvement of
education in all phases.

The knottiest problem concern-
ed racial discrimination, especial-
ly as applied by Southern white
colleges. The final compromise
solution—reached in a dramatic
session hich climaxed
three days—of ulent committee
and panel discussions, Southern
white and Negro caucuses—pro-

vided that NSA “will take action
‘on national, regional, and campus

level through the corresponding
organization of NSA to implement
its stated principles, with regard
to the legal limitations involved.”

A second major problem was
whether the NSA should join the
International Union of Students
(IUiS), whose recent convention
at Prague was distinguished by
the number, of pro-Communist del-
egates. The convention decided
that “although there are funda-
mental differences between the
NSA and the IUS,” it would ask
to join the IUS but only on an
educational, non-political level,
since the American students are
still “desirous of whole-hearted
and fullest cooperation with stud-
ents throughout the world.”

Attempts of political or semi-
political student groups to. gain
representation were side-stepped
when the delegates denied organi-
zations such as the AYD and Stud-
ents for Democratic Action voting
and advisory rights at future con-
ventions. Only officially consti-
tuted student bodies may join
NSA.

Other decisions included: to shun

political groups and political ac-'

tion; to sponsor the World Stud-

ent Service Fund and the ISS; to.
seek one of the three seats ase al"

We think Geraldine Warburg's
suggestion for a less formal, more
strictly spiritual chapel service
was excellent, for all the reasons
she gave. Perhaps ‘Wednesday eve-
ning would be a good time for
speakers to lead an informal dis-
cussion in the Common Room.
The challenge to the Chapel Com-
mittee would be to make the Sun-
day evening service really spirit-
ually satisfying, and the Wednes-
day evening discussions really
worthwhile. We think this is
wholly possible, and that it is the.
most likely solution to the present
problem. We suggest that action
in the form of a poll of student .
support of or oppostion to Ger-
aldine Warburg’s plan be taken..

Within recent years the work of
the Undergraduate Vocationai
Committee has fallen on deaf ears.
Whether the function and work of
the Committee has not been suffi-
ciently clarified, whether the con-
ferences it sponsors have not been
effectively publicized, whether its
program is unsatisfactory — these
and other possible reasons we hope
to discover and correct, so that the
committee together with the Bu-
reau of -Recommendations can
serve student interest to better ad-
vantage this year.

In the past the Committee has
invited six or more. speakers
throughout the year to advise stu-
dents of job opportunities in vari-
ous popular fields, requested by the
college-wide polls. Attendance at
these informal conferences has
been’ increasingly discouraging, at
‘times @mbarrassing.

. The cd-operation of all is neces-
sary, for only by constructive criti-
ciSm can information on job oppor-

tutities be brought to the atten- |

tion: ‘of those who are interested.
We hope all who can will attend an
informal tea in the Common Room,
Thursday, October 30, at 4.80, to
learn more about the Committee
and offer suggestions for its re-
vitalization. Seniors, particularly,

should. take advantage of. the in-}

formation which Mrs. Crenshaw, of
the Bureau of Recommendations,
will make available; and students
of all classes owe it to themselves
to learn how the College can and
is ready to help you in choosing
your field as well as preparing for
and locating the job you want.

Letter from Wilson

As a record of her equally no-
table official life, as Dean and
President. of Bryn Mawr, there are
on view letters from such famous
contemporaries as Emmeline Pank-
hurst, the great English leader for
women’s rights, and Woodrow Wil-
son, a former professor at Bryn
Mawr. Wilson’s letter was writ-
ten in 1885, when Miss Thomas
was Dean of the Faculty, and
concerns examinations and fellow-
ships.

It was while Miss Thomas was

Hall Discussions, Extra
To Give Information
On May Day

To the Editor:

In answer to. a constant stream
of questions from the _ student
body, we would like to report that .
the issue of Big May Day will be
presented during the week of No-
vember 3-8.

It seemed advisable to delay this
presentation until a complete re-
port could be made. This involved
discussion by the College Counéil
(Oct. 15), the decision of the Board
of Directors (Oct. 16), research
and collection of vital statistics by
us and discussion by the Faculty
(Oct. 29).

There will be a News extra com- -
ing out on Monday on the subject
of Big May Day; pictures and per-
tinent information will be posted
in Taylor and on the hall bulletin
boards. General . discussions led
by the Council will be held:

Rock: 10:30 P. M., Monday.

Rhoads: 10:30 P. M., Tuesday.

Every time anyone on this cam-
pus tries to create life or spirit,
the News steps in to kill the spark.
Since the News panned the Broad-
way play “Medea” praised _ by
Brooks Atkinson of The Times, I
should have known that such soph-
omoric criticism would have been
applied to the Junior Show. With
more astuteness Miss Townsend
perhaps would have realized that
the fundamental purpose of the
play was to be “corny.”

My gripe is not with the pseudo-
sophisticated criticism of the Jun-
ior Show alone, but with the criti-
cism of every creative endeavor on
campus. What is the good of de-
structive criticism when the pro-
duction will never be given again?
Isn’t it more to the benefit of nil
to criticize in such a way as to
further enthusiasm for such activi-
The News could have such a
}real part in initiating enthusiasm
rand spirit on campus. It could be
the source of much stimulating
thought and activity instead of the
killjoy it is now.

Last year when this same point
came up in regard to Arts Night,
the News said it, too, was an artis-
tic expression and criticism its
art. Despite the fact that I feel
that the News falls far short of
this goal, I question whether the
purpose of the News is artistic ex-
pression. Since it is the only news-
paper on campus I feel it is its
duty to be a vital accelerator not
a dragging brake.

What difference does it make if
flaws in certain, efforts are left un-
covered? Isn’t the effort behind a
product the most important thing?
We all realize when we start out
on a project it may not reach per-
fection or even completion, but
what we have gained by working
together is so much more impor-
tant than any failure in the final
product.

Another point brought out last
year was that we should be “old”
enough to accept such criticism.
Mature criticism is worth while
but it must be remembered that
age does not bring immunity to
discouragement.

I wish the Editors would ponder
their policy, seek other opinions on
campus and see whether The News
can’t prove to be the necessary or-
gan it might be.

Sincerely yours,
Margo Vorys, ’49.

To the Editor:

We think the “panning” of cam-
pus productions in the College
News should be a closed chapter.
Such a write-up as that of the Jun-
ior Show is pointless and needle
ly harsh; it only serves to hurt the
feelings of the people who are
“panned” and should not be the
proving ground for critical talent.
This applies to Art’s Night, the

freshman hall plays, and _ the
Freshman Show as well.
These are amateur theatrical

productions —to be distinguished
from professional shows of Broad-
way and from the varsity club
plays which obviously aim at a
perfection unattainable without
professional direction and greater
time for rehearsal. The Junior
Show was whipped up very rapidly
but with a great deal of effort and
sacrificed time on the part of
many. The juniors had fun giving
it and the audience seemed to ‘en-
joy it despite its obvidus flaws
which merely added to the fun and
informality of the occasion; this
one would never know from the
review. Every statement of some-
what qualified praise is followed
by a de-bunking phrase, for exam-
ple “The crowd scenes were color-
ful but apt to get flabby,” the kick-
chorus was shapely, from the knee

Logic, Not Propaganda,
Is Weapon Against ~

Communism
To the Editor:

My commendations to the author
of the Editorial this week entitled
“Americanism: Theory .and Prac-
tice.” It seems unbelievable that
Communism has become $0 terrible
a bogey that more and more people
are unable to think clearly about
it and have become convinced that
protection from it lies in persecu-
tion. Creeds and concepts are nev-
er effectively fought by nervous
propaganda such as the Hollywood
hearings. They can only be fought
once they have been fully under-
stood, and then, by the same logic
out of which they have been con-
structed.

We cannot afford to fight Com-
munism with its own political
weapons—repression and totalitar-
ianism. But we can and should
fight it with its own intellectual
weapons—logic and an economic
ideal. Arbitrary trials and. general
accusations do not come under this
heading.

Pat Hochschild, 48.

Students Believe Sane
Probe of Communism
Is Important

To the Editor:

We feel that the editorial
“Americanism: Theory and Prac-
tice,” presents both sides of the
picture only superficially; it is not

well thought: out. The fundamen-
tal issue seems to us to be not so

4much that investigations are being

conducted as the question of how
they are being conducted.

If one opposes investigation of
Communism, then one necessarily
tolerates in this country its prac-
tices and principles. If one sup-
ports the investigations, one ex-
presses a belief that democratic in-
stitutions need a certain amount of
protection. What sort of protec-
tion is the most efficient? The
editorial finds the Hollywood con-
gressional investigation unsatis-
factory. So do we all. It seems
to us that the FBI or Military In-
telligence are the appropriate in-
vestigators. It is a question of
weighing the “civil liberties” of
the Communist group against its
advocation of a form of govern-
ment under which civil liberties as
we know them are practically nil.
We can’t call political investiga-
tion ipso facto persecution.

While we do not condone general
accusations and _ congressional
courts, we consider impartial, sane
investigation for the determination
of who Communists are and what
they are doing important and ne-
cessary.

out of the ordinary and so forth.
Obviously, the reviewer missed
the point of much of the humor.
The jokes were exactly as intend-
ed, corny. And the large number
of parts, especially small ones was.
also as intended—a show aims to
include.everyone-in the fun, not.
to pick professional dramatic tal-
ent. Then, too, the audience seem-
ed to think the plot machine one

:0f the show’s more amusing high-

lights — pointing up a weakness
perhaps, but at least they were the
first to laugh at themselves.

One major item our reviewer
seems to have overlooked is that
this feeble effort which “lacked fi-
nesse” netted approximately $500
for the Alumnae Dirve, a feat for
which we feel the directors and all
the juniors who contributed their
time, talents and good spirits to
the production of the show, are
very greatly to be praised.

that remark was made; though we
have always told ourselves, rather
wistfully, that this is so, it is still
flattering to hear it from outsiders.
Although there is no doubt in the
minds of these Dartmouth men
that we are “here for the business
of learning,” and though our schol-
astic calendar is the only one of
the 12 that is not listed, “because
it is a book in itself,” yet we are
pleased and proud to find ourselves
in demand of a Saturday night.
“We can dance and we can sing’’
should now be our motto; we, too,
can be honey to the week-end bees,
whether drones or werkers, and,
as these cool northerners sum up
our capacities, “The college itself

tainment, but at Bryn Mawr

you're interested”

Department Teas

Yavored in Poll

Last week’s Vocational Commit-

overwhelmingly favors the propos-

teas to be sponsored by the vari-
ous departments, at which faculty
members and recent graduates will
speak and will discuss with the
students the possibilities of job op-

jors. These teas will not be held
under the auspices of single de-
partments, but will be grouped to
include general fields such as mod-
ern languages and social sciences.

Since many students wanted i

the two proposals will be merged,
so that.there will be afitside spe-

In view of last year’s successful
approach to” the’ Alumnae Drive,
it is disappointing to note the lack
of consideration in this year’s ef-
fort.

The negligible publicity of the
New York Theatre Benefit, for ex-
ample, is indicative of the ineffic-
iency in the administration of the
program. Little mention was made
in the New York papers of this
project, which seems to have been
undertaken without adequate prep-
aration. Invitations to the Decem-
ber first performance of Antony
and Cleopatra were mailed scarce-
ly, a month ago, and tickets were
not received, in some cases, before
last week. This lack of foresight
would seem detrimental to the suc-
cess of the Drive which depends
upon the good-will and cooperation
of the friends of the college.

Since the Drive is of fundamen-
tal importance to the college, we
believe it advisable to adopt a
more professional attitude in the
direction of its activities.

number of alternative aspects is
limited. The nature of the object
restricts the number of aspects.
Therefore the problem essential-

ly involves the nature of the ob-
ject itself. Dr. Ushenko interprets
it as being a “formal” nature which
enables one to correlate the as-
pects of it. The.object then is not
actual but potential. The perspect-
ive is a fusion of the fact and the
interpretation.

Dr. Ushenko concluded his lec-
ture by quoting Grace de Laguna
—that all knowledge is in some
perspective; the directed focusing
determines the dynamic perspe¢t-
ive. The object is more than the
aspect; it remains an inexhaust--
ible potentiality, and behind the
actual representation of perspect-

which condition the final aspect."

Arts’ Night was begun as an op-
portunity to present to the campus
the original creative work accom-
plished throughout the year by the
various artistic groups at Bryn
Mawr. The first production was
successful and was considered a
definite indication of undergradu-
ate talent and co-ordination. Un-
fortunately the main responsibility
for the production devolved upon
Mr. Thon, to whom great credit
must be given for the successfub
execution of a very good idea.
However, the inferior production
of last year showed that not only °
was, the support of a great many
students necessary, but also their
active participation.

The discussion about Big May
Day revealed what had been hith-
erto a latent dynamism in the stu-
dent body. This is not to say that
Arts’ Night would be a substitu-
tion for Big May Day, but it seem-
ed to suggest the possibility of ac-
tive campus support in realizing a
similar project.

For this purpose a Committee
has met, consisting of Faculty and
students who partially represent
the groups involved. A student.
committee made up of representa- _
tives from these groups will meet.
in the Common Room on Friday,
at 4:00. Whoever is interested
and has any constructive ideas will
be very welcome. These two com-

to formulate in some measure a&
general plan.

The Provisional Committee
for Arts’ Night.



By Louise Ervin 49

The one enduring and unvarying
institution at Bryn Mawr is the
“Freshman Comp” class. In spite
of: The New Look, the students re-
main much the same, and two hours
of each week are still devoted to
solving within fifty minutes, prob-
lems to which the UN Assembly is
obliged to devote long hours of
discussion.

To savor the true spirit of
Freshman Comp, one must arrive
promptly at eleven oclock. For
while upperclassmen dash _ into
class at 9 3/4 past the hour, the
freshmen have already reached the
third floor of Taylor. Props and
impedimenta vary from hockey
tunic and bathing cap to chocolate
bars (“breakfast”), wrapped in a
peculiarly noisy type of paper.

(The following account presents
Freshman Comp as it appears to
a casual visitor. If these impres-



sions are misleading, they are re-
corded with proper apologies to
professors and students).

Initial_ Skirmish

First on the program is the giv-
ing .of a reading assignment.
Far-removed Seniors who believe
that taking down a reading assign-
ment is a relatively simple opera-
tion, are referred to the first 20
minutes of any English 1 class. On
one morning, the professor reads
out a list of books guaranteed to
provoke thought and start one
along the fact-finding path. The
more alert members of the class
write down all of the professor’s
introductory comments on the book
assigned, perhaps in the hope that
such a digest will serve just as
wellas two hours in the reading
room. The less practical of the
group voice so many varied inter-
pretations of the assignment
(which is inscribed on the black-
board in bold letters filly three



inches high) that it seems prob-

Startling Opin ions, Bright Argyles
Liven Confusion of English Comp.

lematical whether any two will
read the same book or the same
passage.

In ten minutes of this class, 2
barrage of questions is fired, not
to be equalled by an entire semes-
ter of more civilized courses. The
general opinion seems to be that
if you can hold the floor for ten
minutes each class, you may even
get a High Credit. Faintly aud-
ible above the continuous rustling
and whispering is the plaintive
voice of the professor: “It is the
tendency of this class never to get
beyond the first point raised, be-
cause everyone thinks of some-
thing not entirely relevant to that
point.”

Beast vs. Professor

The argument over James’ style
borders on heckling. It is difficult,.
nay almost impossible, for the pro-
fessor to make a point when con-
fronted. bya sea of hands waving
like so much eel grass. More-
over, the Freshman Comp class is
unsurpassed in manoeuvering the
subject to their own line of
thought.-The CHIEF OBSTRUCT-
OR, who knows ALL, fixes a stony
stare upon others whose queries do
not attain her degree of eloquence. “?}
During a lapse in this battle, the
professor reads a passage in il-
lustration. A murmur of approv-
al rises from “the intellects”. Oth-
ers return to concentration on ar-
gyles, with a frantic clicking of
bobbins.

By this time even the professor:
steals frequent glances at the
clock. It is now 11:55. Coats and
Sweaters are pulled on surrepti-
tiously; books and pens are assem-
bled with an attempt at quiet. At
the first sound of Taylor bell, the
innocent visitor is swept aside by
a torrent of self-confident fresh-
men pouring out the door. Se

All of which explains why
Freshman Comp meets only twice.

We have been touched by the
concern shown by two of your con-
tributors over what they choose
to call the lack of consideration,
foresight, efficiency, and profes-
sional attitude applied to the Thea-
tre Benefit as run by the New
York alumnae. It is’ never a bad
idea to consider facts before
launching criticism, so even at this
late date we should like to sum up
for them briefly the steps taken,
as we feel that their letter showed
genuine interest in the manage-
ment of both college and alumnae
affairs and that, of course, is good.

We were not entirely satisfied
with the newspaper’ publicity
which, incidentally, is not necessar-
ily to be had for the asking. We
did, however, send out five releas-
es on the benefit alone, which were
placed in seven spots in six differ-
ent papers.

As to the mechanics regarding
the ticket sale, 2500 “Hold the
Date” cards went out on October
10 to our mailing list, i. e. those
who had been approached for our
benefit last year. On October 24
formal invitations for December
1 were sent to this same list, and
an additional 1000 names. (While
six or seven weeks leeway would
have been preferable to five, this
was not possible; as late as Octo-
ber 9 the opening date for Antony

.|and Cleopatra was advanced by

one month. The original date of
our benefit was December 30, and
our plans had been made accord-
ingly). The list of guests whom
the ‘Undergraduates wished to in-
vite was asked for in October, but
as no Undergraduate chairman
had been elected and therefore no
organization had been set up, this
request was not immediately put
through; it was only because Miss

-Stillman’s_help was called for at

the last moment that we received
a list on November 10. The invi-
tations carried, quite clearly, the
notice that all tickets would be
mailed on November 24; the pur-
pose of this decision, which should
be self-evident, was to make it
possible for those who wanted to
change the size of their party at
the eleventh hour to do so without
a rearrangement of the _ entire
seating chart.

The results of all this inadequate
preparation netted us a sale of 913
tickets and a profit to date of
$7,680. If this be detrimental,
make the most of it.

and I could go on and on, but I
would rather recall certain scenes
and moments not easily to be for-
gotten: the deep dignity and pa-
thos of Nancy Kunhardt’s Cordelia
before her father’s anger; Brooxs
Cooper’s Kent in the stocks, best
of all the beauty of his goodnight
to Fortune; Herbert Cheyette’s
Fool in the storm; Reagan’ and
David Rosenthal’s Cornwall terri-
fying as they turn on Gloucester;
the death of Oswald (most real of
the fights) where R. S. McKinley
was at his best as Edgar; Henry
Levinson’s Edmund, always good,
but magnificent taking up the
challenge of Edgar; E. B. Coale’s
Albany, initially unimpressive, ris-
ing to sudden stature and com-
mand at the close. These are high-
lights that reflect in special inten-
sity the passion and beauty of the
whole performance; for I find I
have dealt largely in superlatives,
but this was a time for enthusiasm.



Students Want Comfort
On Weary Way
To Learning
To the Editor:

Much as we hate to intrude upon
the jollity of this Yuletide season,
we have a gripe.

Some of the restrictions which
has seen fit to
establish in the library seem to us
unfortunate and unnecessary. It
is disheartening to walk in the
front door and be confronted by
row upon row of identical barren
cubicles reminiscent of the mediev-

the “new regime”

We can’t even sit on a
pillow any more or be cheered up

al cell.

by a mere picture as we plow our

weary way through the dim paths
of learning. We see no reason why
our individuality should be swamp-
ed and our harmless pleasures re-
moved for the sake of regimenta-
tion. Certainly a bit of decora-
tion does not appreciably detract
from the general niece of
the reading room.
Is this infringement necessary ?

Current Events

Common Room, December 15. In
Molotov’s speech on the subject of
reparations, “the strength and
weaknesses at the same time of the
Russian casé come out very clear-
ly,” said Dr. Felix Gilbert, speak-
ing on “The Russian Attitude at
the London Conference”.

This speech, he continued, did ac_
tually express “a sensible point of
view”, though it said nothing at all
which has not been said. before.
Yet the American newspapers
seemed to think that the entire
conference, as shown by this talk
especially, was merely a duel of
conflicting opinions in which each
nation did a lot of talking and not
much more.

Papers. Distort Picture

The picture of the conference
presented in the newspapers is not
a fair one, declared Dr. Gilbert. For
the conference did have a definite
agenda which all nations agreed
on and which was followed faith-
fully. “Definite issues were taken
up for discussion.

Why then was such excitement
and furor shown over the Russian
attitude? Because the question of
reparations and its relation to the
economic organization of Germany
is the decisive issue before the
Great Powers. Dr. Gilbert em-
phasized that the Russian case is
strong. in two respects—in her de-
mand for reparations in order to
improve her own economic situa-
tion and in asking German unifi-
cation as a means toward econ-
omic recovery. The weakness of
the Russian case lies in its incon-
sistency, for while she expects the
nations to keep to the Potsdam
agreement, Russia demands rep-
arations delivered from Germany’s
current production, and repara-
tions made from current produc-
tion were excluded under that
agreement.

Ultimatum - Refused

Russia must take either one way
or the other, Dr. Gilbert continued.
At the Conference the Foreign
Ministers, irritated by Molotov’s
evasiveness in avoiding a definite
course of action and simply stating
the same old viewpoint, delivered
an ultimatum which was not ac-
cepted. It is through this failure
of the nations to make concessions
on the question of reparations that



the Conference has been broken
up. :"

When I first visited Bryn Mawr
I was shown the Reading Room of
the library and told that it was
modelled on the dining hall of
Wadham College, Oxford, and that
the desks were similar to those in
the British Mustum. I was told
also that this reading room of
great dignity, without books, was
favored by the students and alum-
nae and regarded by gthem with
great pride. Knowing this and
knowing also something about oth-
er college libraries, I was not a
little surprised to find on closer
inspection that pin-ups were ddorn-
ing the desks—pin-ups of boy
friends, husbands, madonnas, dance
posters, etc., ete. The modern wave
of personalizing things had evi-
dently swept into the reading room
and good taste and pride in the
room’s appearance had flown out.

Students Protest
Because of this, it was a sur-
prise to read in the College News
of December 17, a letter signed by
six students protesting against
“the new regime’s” restrictions as
they feel pin-ups help them to
plow their “weary way through the
dim paths of learning.”

Aesthetic Point of View
Though I think I am right in
saying that college libraries in gen-
eral—Harvard, Vassar, Columbia,
Smith, Holyoke, Barnard, Haver-
ford, Wellesley, etc., etc., do not



allow students to pin up pictures.

in reading rooms and carrels, it
does not necessarily follow that
Bryn Mawr students should con-
form to the prevailing tendency.
So it is not “for the sake of
regimentation” that the students
had their “harmless pleasures” re-
moved but rather from the aesthet-
ic point of view, as well as the
purely practical one of not disfig-
18° on
loan.”

Librarian.

We have 1 to some time that
the News is not as representative of
student opinion or interest as it
might be and hope in the future a
less biased policy will be followed.

Aside from a general dissatisfac-
tion which we have felt about this
matter, our attention was focused
on it by your coverage of the World
Government Week. We think the
basis for selection of news should
be student interest: and importance
of the event. In your last issue
one-sixtieth of your space was de-
voted to a movement in which at
least 15 per cent of the student
body was actively involved. When
informed, the majority of the stu-
dents were very interested, wheth-
er they supported the ideology be-
hind the drive or not, but many had
had no idea of the real. significance
from the News article. Although
the drive had its own publicity on
campus, the News would have
greatly aided in reaching interested
people.

Too Much Wit?

We feel that to focus attention
on such articles as the original and
amusing piece entitled “Bev-Chuq,
Moh-Philad, etc.,” places undue em-
phasis on the witty, to the detri-
ment of an enterprise in which not
only Bryn Mawr students, but the
whole community were engaged.
The News can harm or help a
movement by its policy, and we feel
that such an important activity
should not have been so lightly dis-
missed. The students are interest-
ed in news of lasting importance
just as much as in being amused.
In being selective, we hope that the
News board will reconsider what
their obligations as mouthpiece for
student interests are, and try to be
more representative.

Into the depths of pre-exam de-

Last Nightérs
“Mr. Roberts” Hailed

For Dramatic Impact,
Excellent Cast

by Barbara Bettman 749

Mister Roberts, which opens
next week in New York after two
weeks in Philadelphia, will doubt-
less be a smash hit.

Philadelphia reviewers hailed
it as the “What Price Glory?” of
this wdr, and named it for the Pu-
litzer Prize. While I would nom-
inate A Streetcar Named Desire
for such a prize, there is no ques-
tion that Mister Roberts is an ex-
cellent, compact, brilliantly exe-
cuted play.

Based on the novel written by
Thomas Heggen, the play con-
cerns life on a Navy cargo ship,
the crew of which ‘has had no lib-
erty for fourteen months. On this
hulk has been erected mast and
sails of considerable artistic com-
petence and worth. The differences
between the “regular” Navy and
the young officers of the USNR
during the war is sharply pointed
up but never overdone. Particu-
larly in the conversation between
Mr. Roberts and the Captain in the
latter’s room are the basic differ-
ences most clearly delineated.

Fonda Has Lead

Henry Fonda in the title role is|
perfectly cast*and equally convinc-
ing as: the young lieutenant whois
torn betwen love and concern for
his men and a desire to get into
action. The final scene between him
and the crew is one of the most
touching I have ever seen, without
a trace.of the maudlin.

_ William Harrigan as the Cap-
tain is possibly the worst—or the
best—villain-.since vaudeville; he
almost has the audience hissing.
His extremely difficult part is well-
sustained and the completely grip-
ping quality of the play is due in
large part to him. David Wayne
switches from leprechaun to the
role of Ensign Pulver with no dif-
ficulty and has the funniest scene
in the play. Robert Keith as Doc
is sympathetic and humorous, es-

A. A. Sends Gift
To Bridget West

Over two hundred dollars was
collected from the student body by
A. A! representatives to send to
Bridget West, Bryn Mawr’s adopt-
ed player on the British Hockey
team. Cooperating with other
Philadelphia schools and colleges
in this project of sending food and
needed articles to British Hockey
team players, Bryn Mawr has al-
ready shipped to Bridget a box of
staples containing lard, butter, tea,
rice, and sugar, plus an eleven-
pound tinned ham!

Libby Bagley, president of the
A. A. explained that CARE pack-
ages were thought inappropriate,
since the A. A. wanted contribu-
tions to be as personal and flexible
as possible.

The A. A. thanks both the rep-
resentatives for their excellent job
and the student body for contrib-
uting so generously. Any money
that is left over will be kept for
hext year, or given to a school or
college whose funds were not so
ample.

Mister Roberts is a very funny
play, but not a laugh was audible
during its serious passages. There
are no pulled punches; all its pow-
er and impact are made evident by
the superb direction, as well as the
grouping on the stage and the ac-
tion. Mister’ Roberts is the most
professional performance (in all the
praiseworthy meaning of that
word) that I have seen in a long
time—in short, a satisfying and
gripping evening at the theatre.

The College News never worries
about empty mail tables! Each
week brings many fascinating re-
quests and communiques. Why just
the other day we were invited to
attend the Dartmouth Winter Car-
nival! _The erstwhile young gentle-
man, who “sincerely hoped” -we
would come, also added some fash-

‘ion hints, advising us — “By all

means bring a two-piece ski-suit”
(two-piece, mind you) “or a skirt
and sweater.” He also suggested
that woolen ankle socks are cer-
tainly in good taste.

The same mail brought us an in-
vitation from the Intercollegiate
Association for Study of the Al-
cohol Problem... They wanted an
essay on “Applying Preventive
Medicine to Alcoholism.” Would
the Carnival give us a lead on this
or should we refer them to The
Clipsheet of the Board of Temper-
ance?

A further perusal of our mail re-
veals that “Spike and Dorothy, aid-
ed and abetted by assorted City
Slickers . .. have whipped up a
typical ‘Spotlight Revue’ specialty.”
(We can’t wait to hear them.) And
that the-Faith Orchestra and Chor-
us are ready to entertain us in
“The Pause that Refreshes.”

From this we turn to a billet-
doux from the War Department im-

Miss Gertrude Ely ended her.
talk at last week’s Current Events
with a plea fot the admission of
displaced persons into the USA.
There are still nearly a million
living in DP camps because they
have nowhere to find jobs that will
support them. There are skilled
and unskilled workers and profes-
sionals who could find useful work
here in our country.

The Stratton Bill (H. R. 2910)
would admit 100,000 people annu-
ally for a four-year emergency
period. This totals less than half
the number which was allowed by
our quota System for 1989-1945 but
the war prevented more than a
trickle of immigrants from com-
ing. These displaced persons would
be screened for health,~économic
status etc., ‘according to the usual
immigration procedure. There is
a similar bill now in the Senate
Committee. Write to your Senat-
ors to back it, write to your Con-
gressman to back the House bill—-
HR 2910.

B. M. Grad in England
Advocates Course

At Stratford
Reading, England
To the Editor:

I hear that March 15 is the clos-
ing date for application to the
Shakespearean Summer School at
Stratford-on-Avon run by Birming-
ham University. I thought, there-
fore, that a brief note from one
who attended the six-weeks course
last summer might help to decide
some of the undecided.

The program was exciting ‘and
varied—including not only “straight
Shakespearean” but lectures in
Elizabethan art, music, manuscript
reading, and social background
given by experts. Needless to say,
living in the Shakespearean coun-
try and travelling to nearby places
of interest was an education in
itself, as was the “international”
atmosphere of the summer school.

I might add, for those who wish
(as I did) to use the summer
course largely as an excuse for a
longer visit to Europe—that not
only did I get a job through the
University contacts when my
money gave out, but I was also sent’
by them to this special course at
Reading. And I find that what
Reading has to offer is so exactly
what I want that I plan to start
work on a Ph.D., next fall!

All this starting from a short
summer course! I do not think
that I need to say how really
“wizard” I consider the Englisi
people and their very much alive
country!

I hope that many other Bryn
Mawr students will make use of
such an opportunity this coming
summer. Sincerely,

While I am in no postition to
judge the merits of Miss Low’s
play, there are two points in her
recent letter with which I should
like to take issue. Before doing so,
however, I wish to state that I com-
pletely agree with her in that the
original review was.of no construc-
tive help to the author.

Miss Low tells us that “play-
wrights have always written for
audiences, to entertain them, not to
lecture or preach to them.” -I can-
not agree. On the contrary, the
better playwrights have always
produced something besides sheer
entertainment. Sophocles, Aristo-
phanes and Plautus did not merely
entertain. Will anyone claim that
Shakespeare never preaches or lec-
tures? Are Bernard Shaw, Max-
well Anderson, Eugene O’Neill
dramatists ‘who have provided
nothing but frothy entertainment?

The article of last week’s NEWS
on “Jobs Discussed at the Lan-
guage Tea” was a great disap-
pointment to those of us who heard
the excellent discussions presented
at the Vocational Committee Tea.
We especially wish to call atten-
tion to the statement of Mrs. Hill
which we feel was either misinter-
preted or falsely emphasized by
the NEWS. From the context of
her talk we feel that Mrs. Hill
would not have wished so much
emphasis placed upon the quota-
tion which the NEWS has chosen
to print. It is true that a knowl-
edge of history, economics or poli-
tics is certainly as necessary for
certain government positions as
the language pre-requisite but we
do not think that Mrs. Hill meant
by any means to imply that they
were “more important than the
knowledge of a language,’ as the
NEWS has stated. The necessity
of a very thorough knowledge of
one or more languages was empha-
sized, this knowledge being one ac-
quired not merely from reading,
but rfom actual social and inter-
cultural relations as well. Certain-
ly Mrs. Hill did not wish to give
the impression, as the NEWS has
probably unknowingly done, of de-
preciating the value of a career in
languages, which was so _intelli-

‘gently albeit humorously presented

by the speakers.

ony, he saved himself by the ef-
fectiveness of his contrasts. The
strength of his emotion toward his

June Moyer, as the neighbor Tia

Mental Hosp. Has
Job for Summer

This summer Bryn Mawr, Hav-

soring a student work project at
the Norristown Mental Hospital.

This project offers unusual op-
portunities for learning about men-
tal illness and for reaching an un-
derstanding of this unfortunate
manifestation of our society. As
regular attendants the students
will be working directly with the
patients, doing what they can with
their limited experience and op-
portunity to help the patients
reach a more healthy state of
mind, doing what they can to
raise the standards of care for the
mentally ill, and perhaps learning
such valuable personal assets as
self-control, tact and perseverance
in the face of frustrating experi-
ences.

Educational opportunities offer-
ed under this program include at-
tending staff meetings, direct con-
tact with hospital. personnel, and
lectures as well as the actual work
in the hospital."

“Enclosed please find a copy of
the NEWS, with the important
items underlined. I wouldn’t want
you to miss this issue, come what
may. It shows that the girls at
BMC are too mature for words,
and besides just simply intellec-
tual. Bettman, Cave, Townsend,
and Holborn, with all their mag-
nificent background, mellowed by
a timeless sense of stability and ,
intimate knowledge of the Arts,
certainly are well qualified to
write critically on any culturak
pursuit. It’s positively amazing
that girls who are so young have
such a wealth of understanding
and experience to draw from. I
can only withdraw, when reading
their poignant critiques, into a
great sense of my own inade-
quacy.”

Earlier this year we received re-

however, we would be happy to

if a sufficient number of people are

many people would take such a.

course. If you are in favor of this
proposal, please speak to a mem-

In announcing the merger of the
“Title” and the “Quarto”, we feel
a few explanations are in order.
First of all, why have we done it‘
Because we feel that one large
Magazine can serve Bryn Mawi
and* Haverford better than twc
little ones. Because, artistically
and financially, cooperation is bet-
ter than competition. Secondly
how does the merger fit both cam-

/puses? It makes possible publica-

tion of more writing of more kinds
by more people. Our editorial policy
is to produce in print the bes.
writing that is submitted to us anc
to give the colleges a magazine
they will enjoy reading.

Finally, why ‘Counterpoint’?
Webster’s definition is “a melody
moving attended by a related
but independent melody”. (Neither
magazine loses its identity, but in
“Counterpoint” there will be a va-
riety of material and a breadth of
scope which neither the “Title” nor
the “Quarto” could tachieve alone.

This is an expertment and, like
all experiments, favorable external
conditions are indispensable to its
success. (We need support. By
support we mean {two things, con-
tributions and subscriptions, the
what to print and the wherewithal
to print it.

Summer Theatre Had
Successful Season;
Gave Five Plays

To the Editor:

So many people have asked about
the outcome of the Bryn Mawr
College Summer Theatre that this
seems the best way to answer. We
had a company of forty men and
women from twenty different
schools and colleges including mem-
bers from as far west as Michigan,
as far south as Georgia. Eight
students were from Bryn Mawr
and among the other colleges
represented were Harvard,’ Yale,
Smith, Wellesley, and Vassar. Dur-
ing the six-week season five pro-
ductions were given, one each week,
including two original plays. State
of the Union opened the program
and drew an attendance of 843,
A Family Story (new) 671, How
Bright the Moon (new) 804, Ten
Little Indians 1102, Stage Door
1491. By the end of the season, in
addition to class-work, nearly every
member of the company interested
in acting had acted not only a sup-
porting part but also a leading
role. Production erew-work was
rotated so that everyone gained a
beginning knowledge of the entire
theatre (for State of the Union
four complete sets were built,
painted, and installed on the stage
within eight days). The lecturers
from New York—John Mason
Brown, Donald Oenslager, Jose Li-
mon, et al —were stimulating, in-
forming, and greatly appreciated.
The attempt to establish a repre-
sentative audience by keeping the
admission prices low was success-
ful (general admission was 60c,
reserved seats were $1.20). The
theatre did not lose money and,
benefitting from the experience
gained in this first season, will con-
tinue next summer.

Commendation is_ particularly
due Ann Seideman of Bryn Mawr,
Richard McKinley of Haverford,
and Wood Tate of Swarthmore for
their exceptional work as assis-
tants. Pictures of the productions

Mrs. Diez to Aid
Foreign Students

Attention all Bryn Mawr stud-
ents of foreign citizenship! In the
future all visa difficultiés, all pass-
port complications, in fact any

problem not directly connected with
academic work need not worry you.

With the percentage of foreign
students past the 10% mark, the
need for one person to advise these
students and to maintain an office
from which all communications to
Immigration authorities, various
consulates could be sent became
acute. Mrs. Martha M. Diez, there-
fore, will act at consultant for all
foreign students both graduate and
undergraduate. Mrs. Diez will be
available in her office (First. Floor
Library, North Side) Monday,
Wednesday and Friday 12-1 P. M.;
Monday -5 P. M.; Thursday 3-4
P. M. and by appointment. If neces-
sary, foreign students may call
her in her office at these times.

As suggested at the conference
of the National Association of
Faculty Advisers last spring, the
Foreign Student Adviser will act
as a central agent through whom
all matters concerning foreign
students will be settled. Her main
purpose is to make their stay at
Bryn Mawr and the U. S. as suc-
cessful as possible; so although
actual programs must be decided
upon by the student in conjunction
‘with her major department and the
Dean, Mrs, Diez will be happy to
assist any girl in planning ~~

The question of pictures and
other aids to comfort in the lib-
rary has arisen early this year. We
recall a similar complaint made
last year, justifying the barren-
ness of the main reading room by
the fact that it was copied from
an Oxford College dining hall. All
the Oxford dining halls are warm-
ed by multitudes of pictures on
their walls. We realize that pic-
tures and cushions in the reading
room and carrells tend to detract
from their neat appearance, but
they do express individual tastes.

The desks are loaned to us, we
realize, but, in the carrells
especially, this loan extends for
one year to one student exclu-
sively. So long as nothing detri-
mental is done by way of tempor-
arily improving the cold wood or
steel, we see no reason why objec-
tions should be raised.

Summer Hospital Work
Gives New Outlook

On Mental Cases
To the Editor:

A group of us would like to take
this opportunity to tell you what
we did this summer. Not because
we’re proud of what we did, but
because we feel that what we had
the opportunity to observe and learn
carries a message for everyone.
We worked at the Norristown
State Hospital—a mental hospital.

We. were not working with
“crazy people”, we were working
with people like you and like me,
people with the same everyday hu-
man problems, fears... our pa-
tients might have been you.

Student Unit

The 24 students who worked
there were from Bryn Mawr, Hav-
erford and Swarthmore. We form-
eda “unit,” similar to projects spon-
sored by the Friends’ Service Com-
mittee. It is hoped that more
units of this kind will be started in
other colleges and universities en-
abling more students, than just
those studying psychology or med-
ecine, to benefit by this stimulating
sort of work. Because we lived as
a unit, (“headquarters” were two
dorms at Haverford) we were able
to get a more comprehensive view
of the hospital and the problems
arising in our daily contacts with
the patients and hospital person-
nel. Numerous bull-sessions, group
recreation and the. comradeship
that comes through being part of a
unit, contributed to making it 2
most profitable and enjoyable sum-
mer.

We were officially employed by
the hospital as attendants. In this
capacity we had the opportunity
to work directly with the patient,
to talk to him, to try in a very
small way to help him adjust to
his problems, regain his .self-con-
fidence and to lead again a normal
life-We-werepermitted to attend
staff meetings, read case histories.
—the doctors . gave lectures on
mental illness and psychiatry. We
also felt the civic, if not personal,
problem created by an understaff—
ed, overcrowded hospital, which
because of ignorance and preju- .
dice, is unfortunately the rule and
not the exception in mental hospi-
tals.

It was an invaluable experience
for all of us and challenging in its
social significance. Because we
are so firmly convinced of the first
unit’s success, we hope to interest
you in helping us organize an even:
better unit for next summer.

Last week monitoring of classes
began, bringing into effect in its
wake the Bryn Mawr cut system.
This cut system cannot be defined
in numerical terms because there is
no magic number of allowed cuts.
In theory regular attendance at all
classes is expected; excused cuts
are given for illness and for other
reasons approved by the Dean’s of-
fice. Any other cut is unexcused.

This does not mean necessarily
that cutting a class is penalized by
a set rule. Penalties are invoked
by certain professors and in cer-
tain courses even though the num-
be. of cuts taken may be small.
Reminders and notices about over-

cutting are based on the individual |

student’s record and depend for the
most part on Mrs. Marshall’s dis-
cretion.

Alternative Systems

‘bnere are two alternatives to the
present cut system: setting up a
nume.ical limit which would be in-
flexibie or abandoning a cut system
completely... ‘The latter method was
tried at Bryn Mawr four years ago.
At the end of that academic. year
approximately eight times the nor-
mal number of people were exclud-
ed trom college by the Senate for
academic deficiencies. The next
fall a request from the student
body brought to the Faculty by the
Student Curriculum Committee set
up the present cut system—a sys-
tein Wicn can function if everyone
sees tuac sne has signed the moni-
toring chart correctly, reports late-
nesses to the Dean’s office and
takes on herself the responsibility
for keeping track of her cuts. The
Cut Committee will continue to
post charts in the halls about once
u month, but any student may
check these records in the Dean’s
Ou.ce at any time.

We feel that a change in the
present -arrangements-_on cuts
would be unwise; we would be hap-
py to-receive comments or sugges-
tions, however.

Radnor’s Six Who Pass While
the Lentils Boil was delightful.
Elaine Marks as the little boy was
a most enchanting element of this
play; in fact Stuart Walker might
have written this play especially
for its nine Radnor participants.
We were charmed by the Mime and
his three balls that never got jug-
gled ((though we are sure they
eouldhave been) and by all four
verses of Katouska Cheremeteff’s
ballad. We were impressed by the
sizes of the tall and terrible Heads-
man and his axe (Bunny Dean),
and the little milkmaid (Betsy Tal-
iafero). We were tickled by Julie
Burke’s patient explanation of the
nature of a lentil and depressed by
Barry Seymour’s effective portray-
al of the blindman. Marcelle Wegier
couldn’t have been more like a
butterfly and Cynthia Mason looked
exactly like a queen, though she
did seem a little remote and amused
by the whole business, which is
possibly what Mr. Walker meant.

we are concerned. Entitled the
Gold Rush, it was a far cry from
49’s “Big as Life’ which was our

acted, staged, and produced by the:
patients with our help. The char-
acters, consisting of hero, heroine,,
villain, and chorus, moved within:
the simplest of plots. Jane Ann
took the part of the heroine, while:
Brenda, Skip, and Margo were the
kick chorus, wives, and any other
part needing a girl. We played be-

I am glad the NEWS is. tak-
ing an interest in music. I have
never thought that the existence of
an intelligent audience is related to
anything ‘but general. level of
taste in the student body and prop-
er catering to it. However, there
are certain considerations that I
think ought to be made quite clear
before we plan, and the first con-
cerns money.

Single concerts, if not guaran-
teed, are a tremendous risk. A ser-
ies, of course, is double, triple, or
quadruple the risk. People do not
buy tickets until they know what
they are getting and if not enough
like what is offered, someone has to
pay the deficit. Stars who’ might
fill Goodhart, if it were possible
to sell cheap seats throughout the
hall, cost too much to be paid by
that means. There are not enough
seats in Goodhart even at $3.50 or
$4.00 apiece to cover that sort of
concert. Incidentally, the acoustics
of the hall are such that many out-
siders who might have $3.50 or
$4.00 do not buy tickets.

Concert Poll Tax

The only possible way, it seems
to me, of financing concerts on the
campus is to have a sum of money
available for concert series raised
by a small poll tax, as an addition
to Alliance or other dues, and a
similar contribution from other
campus inhabitants. The college
can then cut its coat according to
its cloth, and the sale of additional
single tickets provides some gravy
and perhaps some additional con-
certs, but at least no concerts
would then be arranged until the
cost was guaranteed. There is an
objection, I know, to the sale of
series tickets. The small faculty
group, of which I am a member,
continually receives requests from
people who want only a single con-
cert. ‘However, we can’t arrange
concerts until the money is in hand
for at least the first three or four,
and are thus unable to depend on
the sale of single tickets. If we
were stuck by poor weather or by
a program which did not have a
popular appeal we should have no
funds with which to pay our way;

‘'so a basic minimum of fifty or

sixty subscribers is essential to our
existence. If we have that, we sell
single admissions, but not before.



Promising Artists

| My suggestion for college music
is to abandon the idea of. getting
great stars, that is to say, well-
known musicians, to the campus;
to abandon Goodhart concerts until
we have a pretty good audience
educated to it,and to use The Dean-
ery which holds some 200 people
for samll concerts of a sort that
can easily be financed. For exam-
ple, the concerts of the Wayne Tri-
County Association average in cost
about $400, the money for which is
collected in the beginning of the
year. These concerts are given hy
promising artists just out of
schools (like Mr. Goldstein a week
or two back), or by first-chair men
from the Orchestra (Mr. Kincaid,
Miss Phillips and Mr. Mayes gave
a wonderful concert three years
ago), and by quartets and trios,
local people whose fees are not
quite so high as those of national-
ly known organizations. Orches-
tras are obviously too expensive
and only when funds are in hand
can more ambitious projects, like
the Budapest quartet, be undertak-
en.

by the Reverend Howard Thurman,
Minister for the Church (for the
Fellowship of All Peoples, San
Reverend

Thurman discussed the demands
of high religion upon the authentic
patriotism of the United States.

Reverend Thurman praised those
who believe that life is not com-
plete but. “fluid and dynamic” and
said that creative purposes are the
goals of the living. He cited three
reasons for the relationship of the:
power and significance of an inte-
grated goal.” The goal inspires the
second reason, the “willingness to.
surrender not only one’s resources
but one’s very life.” If the goal be-
comes evil, however, it causes the
individual to lose his sense of di-
rection and standard of behavior.
This was the cause of the powerful
appeal of fascism, a “socially re-
demptive goal” which caused the
destruction of millions. The third
reason is “a sense of participation
in a collective destiny.” No one
can stand isolation or being ignor-
ed; he must be part of a group of
other persons.

Meaning of Thanksgiving

Reverend Thurman claimed that.
if these ideas are applied to the
history of America and its relig-
ious faith, a new meaning is given
to Thanksgiving. The United
States is an example of different
peoples united by a “creative
ideal.” ;

The atomic bomb heralded an
age in which no isolation exists.
The “whole planet earth” has had
to participate in the experience of
unity which had formerly belonged
only to the United States. Rever-
end Thurman said “Life sent us to
school to learn how people of dif--
ferent cultures may develop a
sense of the whole, so that when
the atomic age appeared we could
teach the whole world, that had nos.
had a chance to go to school.”

I appreciated your article and ed-
itorial about the United Service
Fund in last week’s NEWS very
much. Since this is the Fund’s first
year, it still ranks as an experi-
ment, and therefore, opinions and
suggestions, the franker the better,
are very welcome.

In exact figures a sum of $3,-
324.60 was raised. Only one hall,

""

and that was due to the faci that
many people gave way over the
$7.50 asked, for eight people there
gave nothing at all. The other halls
are behind their quotas as follows:
Denbigh, $66.50; Merion, $144.00;
Pem East, $64.75; Pem West,
$97.75; Radnor, $67.75; Rhoads S.,
$81.50; Rock, $184.65; and Wynd-
| ham, $25.50.

The final non-residents results
are not yet in, at the moment they
are behind $210, but that is not a
fair statement of their donation.

With this lack of $942.40, the
charities will all suffer: Red Cross
will get $648.55 instead of $800;
Care will get $543.02 instead of
$670; Care for Children will get
$321.78 instead of $400; United
World Student Service Fund will
get $212.24 instead of $320; and
the Reserve Fund is $450 instead
‘of $710.

Community Chest has_ been
pledged $860, for that is what it
got last year. According to the per-
centages, as they are worked out,
it only gets $642.55. The $156.45
will have to come either out of the
Reserve Fund or from any more
money which may be raised. Since
the committee for the drive prom-
ised that this would the only chari-
ty drive all year, I do not believe
that it should go back on its prom-

“Counterpoint” Review
Found Harsh by

Seniors

To the Editor:

- We think the first issue of Coun-
terpoint in itself and in compari-
son with previous Titles has ach-
ieved considerable distinction. For
the first time we have a college
magazine with variety in mood, in
style, and content. The NEWS

In reply to, the editorial request:
in the NEWS of January 12th for-
information concerning the plan--
ning, care, and distribution of food.

the halls, we should like to sup--
ply the following facts:

The menus for all halls are plan--
ned by the College dietitian, and
are reviewed by the College doctor..
They are posted, as students know,,.
in the hall dining rooms. While the:
food is planned by the dietitian, the
quantities are ordered by the man-
agers based on their information.
concerning the numbers of students.
who will be present. The more ac-
curate information the managers.
have, the more accurately and eco--
nomically they can order.

Food Delivered Daily

Milk and bread are delivered di-
rectly to the halls. Fresh vege-.
tables, meat, and fruit are delivered.
to the central store room where
they are checked, divided into the.
desired quantities, and sent to the:
halls by the College truck. Food
is received and delivered daily ex-
cept Sunday. Large refrigerators
and deep freeze units are located
both at the central store room, and
in each hall. Little food is kept in
either the hall or store room refrig-
erators for any length of time. The-
College seldom has more than a
twenty-four hour supply of fresh
food on hand.

Everyone responsible for the
food in the halls was greatly con-
cerned over the digestive upsets.
which occurred in Rockefeller on
January 10th, and which were, we
believe, the result of something the
students ate. As the editors of the-
NEWS knew, the college doctor:
and dietitian started an investiga-
tion immediately which included a.
complete investigation of the kit-
chens- plus-a- chemical analysis of
the food. We have not yet received
a full report on the latter.

Suggestions Received

On the subject of general sug--
gestions, the dietitian will try to
reduce the starch content of meals
to meet present requests of stud--
ents. We also try to avoid the “one
color” meals—the “white,” ‘“yel--
low,” and “red” meals to which
students are sensitive, but students
will have to invent new vegetables,
the dream of all dietitians—to: pro-
duce meals with a rainbow range.
Although coffee was not mentioned.
in the NEWS editorial, we receive:
such conflicting comments —it is
too weak and too strong—in the
same hall on the same day, and
there is so much misinformation
concerning it that we should like
to correct one misapprenhension..
Contrary to popular belief, break-
fast coffee is not served at dinner,
nor dinner coffee served at break-
fast. Coffee is made fresh twice
daily in each hall. We are sorry’
to read that the NEWS states:
“Complaints are continual,” be-
cause actually very few reach the
managers and the dietitian. We
should like to urge students to ex-
press themselves directly to the
managers and the dietitian, es-
pecially if there has been any spe-
cific difficulty.

Sincerely,
ei Charlotte Howe-

The attention of the student body
is called to a project which the
National Student Association voted
to sponsor at the Madison Conven-
tion last August — the Purchase
Card System. This™ system pro-
vides the means whereby the stud-
ent of a member NSA college may
buy a Purchase Card for one dol-
lar which will entitle her to sales
discounts on merchandise pur-
chased at stores in the college com-
munity or any other community
throughout the U.S. in which the
plan has been put into effect. The
plan operates on the theory that
the merchant will honor the Pur-
chase Card and give the student
a discount in return for the as-
surance of--added patronage,

Because NSA is promoting this
plan and because it has worked
successfully at many universities
and colleges, the NSA campus
committee feels that it should be
presented to the student body who
may then decide whether we should
establish it here. For this reason,
I would like to present both sides
of the question in hopes of elicit-

of serious deliberation and carefu.
consideration of the plan’s impli-

On March 8rd two students from.
Ursinus; Joseph Beardwood and
Alvin Knepper, came to Pembroke
East to see the Bryn Mawr radio
station. They have offered to give
their time and assistance so that.
we may have WBIMC operating
again. With their aid and a mini-
mum of financial backing the radio.
station will be in operation before
the end of this semester.

When Pembroke East was con-
verted to A.C. current three years
ago the Bryn Mawr radio station
was forced to shut down, because.
it would have ‘been too difficult to
run lines into the halls on D.C..
surrent, We not only lacked
money, but a great deal of work
would have to be done by an ex-
pert. .

This year Jane Wickham~and
Seta Mahakian became interested
in the possibilities which college
radio presents. With help from
Wray Bentley of Haverford, they
got the station into operation so
that it could be heard in Pem East.
There still remained the drawback
of the other halls which run on
D.C. current.

In college radio programs there
is a chance for much expression of
talent. A large number of Bryn
Mawr students who are not chosen
for the Drama Guild productions
would jump at the opportunity to
take part in radio plays. Those
who are interested could do ex-
perimental radio script writing and
directing. They might even use a
sound effects man! For a small
monthly charge we can rent a tele-
phone line to Haverford College
which would make it possible for
us to exchange broadcasts. Some-
time in the future we might form a
local network with Haverford, Ur-
sinus, Valley Forge Hospital and
Swarthmore.

When all the major colleges and
most of the smaller ones have
campus radio stations it seems too
bad that Bryn Mawr should not
have one in operation also. The
authorities have taken no interest.
in giving us funds so all support.
has had to come from outside
sources, such as WHaverford and
Ursinus . . Doesn’t Bryn Mawr
care about putting its neglected
radio station back on the air?

On behalf of the Alliance, and
for the sake of the record, I would
like to correct a statement which
appeared in the 1949 Yearbook. In
its writeup of college organiza-
tions, the Yearbook states that
“the Alliance never lets us forget
that there is an outside world in
desperate confusion and appropri-
ates $7.50 from our allowances to.
help put it to rights.” The Alliance:
wishes it were the happy recipient
of $7.50 from every student, since
the scope of its activities could
be greatly broadened if this were
the case. I would like to point out,
however, that the Alliance, like
Self-Gov, Undergrad, A.A., and
N.S. A., is financed by Common
Treasury dues, and this year re-
ceived $1.80 per student. The
League is the lucky organization,
which through its Activities Drive,
solicits $7.50 from each student.

Wittkower Describes
Bernini and Parisians
Continued from page 1

building. Bernini moreover sug-
gested an exterior facade with ar-
caded windows, reminiscent of the
Italian palazzos, while on the in-
terior facade, which encloses the
courtyard in the center of the
Louvre, he wanted a colonade, as in
Italian cortiles. Also, whereas
French architecture of the period
insisted on flat, straight facades,
Bernini, as was the trend in Italian
Baroque architecture, made use of
curves in his facade plans. This
was another of the many points of
controversy between Bernini and
Colbert.

Bernini, Dr. Wittkower said,
clung obstinately to his ideas, and
made but few changes in his plans
to satisfy Colbert and the king: his
art came before his patron, In the
end, the commission was given to
Claude Perrault, brother of Charles
Perrault. Perrault stituted, for
the grandeur of Bernini’s proposed
building, the comfort and intimate.
connection between structure and
appearance that was expected in
French architecture.

Showing slides of the bust of
Louis XIV, one of ‘Bernini’s grand-
est pieces of portraiture, Dr. Witt.
kower talked at some length about
Bernini’s sculptural technique. Ber-
nini would first make many sketch-
es of his model in motion, for he -
believed that these spontaneous
sketches best revealed the person-
ality of his model. Then he would
work on clay models, from the
sketches and from memory, never
directly from the subject. This
method, as Dr. Wittkower observ-
ed, involves more concentrated ap-
plication than any other sculptural
technique.

Discusses Bust

Dr. Wittkower discussed the bust
of Louis XIV as an example of the
idealization that is found in all of
Bernini’s sculpture, and which here
is- harmoniously blended with the
realism. Though some of the fea-
tures are particularly realistically
depicted, it is always for the sake
of the general effect of the por-
trait, to which all else is subordin-.
ated; while on the other hand, al-
ways for the same purpose, some
other features are greatly minimiz-
ed. On the whole ,it is the general
expression of the king, rather than
an accurate resemblance, that Ber-
nini renders.

Dr. Wittkower concluded his lec-
ture with a few general remarks
on the basic differences there were
at the time not only between
French and Italian art, but also be-



the essence of life is still a mystery.

As a matter of fact we have
found the News to be rather a
right-wing sheet. For example, it
supports long - standing Bryn

students, and upholds the oral sys-

tone of the editorials, reviews, and
straight reporting, places it in
sharper relief. We hope the News

Mrs. Manning Corrects
Misconceptions
In Article

To the Editor of the College News,

I wish to correct two mistakes.
which appear in the report of my
remarks in Current Events om
October 24th.

In the first place, General Omar
Bradley was not representing “the
air force point of view”. He is, of
course, the Chief of Staff of the
Army, having been second in com-
mand to General Eisenhower ir
the second. world war. It was the
fact that he is the representative
of the Army on the organizatior:
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff which
made his support of the air force
against the Navy so decisive.

In the second place, it was obvi-
ously General Bradley and not.
“Mrs. Manning” who said, “As 2
believer in humanity I deplore the
use of the atomic bomb, but as 2
soldier I respect it as a weapon.”

Finally, lest others in the audi-
ence may have shared the feelings
of the poet whose work appears in
the next column to the report on
Current Events, I wish to state
emphatically that Professor Mich-
els and I believe that the preser-
vation of world peace, and the
strengthening of the United Na-
tions is the most important object
for which-any -human~-being -cair
work today. It was our purpose to
draw attention to the very dan.
gerous situation which has been
created by the failure of the na-
tions to agree on a-system for the
control of atomic energy. My owr
view is that failing such agree-
ment it would be better for the
United States to pledge itself, as
the nation possessing the largest
supply of atomic bombs,/not to
use them unless they are first used
by an enemy power. I believe that
such a pledge might do something
to check the armaments race in
which Russia» and the United
States are at present engaged, and
which, if continued, must almost
inevitably. lead to a third world
war.

Six Players Make
I. C. Hockey Team

On Saturday, November 5, the
Bryn Mawr Hockey Varsity went
to the Inter-Collegiate Tryouts,
which were held on the Swarth-
more College fields. It was a ter'-
ribly cold day; so the team spent
its time playing fiercely or huddled
{n sweat pants and blankets. Bryn
Mawr played three matches dur-
ing the day, and was- quite success—
ful. The first match was again
Temple, and though we lost 1-0
Bryn Mawr played very well, as
Temple had a terrific team. After
lunch Bryn Mawr played and tied
Ursinus. This was the best match
of. the day both in good hockey and
in enjoyment for Bryn Mawr. In-
cidentally it was wonderful to tie
them, because they beat us when
Bryn Mawr played them a few.
weeks ago. The third match was
with West Chester, and after 2
very exhausting ~ thirty-—-minute-.
half, Bryn Mawr emerged decided-
ly victorious, 2-1. When the list
was read out of the players asked
back to continue to the final try-
outs the next day, Bryn Mawr
found with great excitement that
six of our players were asked hack.
This is almost the greatest number
that Bryn Mawr has ever had. The
players who went back to the fina
tryouts were: S. Hayes, J. Stone,
M. Shaw, S. Savage, L. Perkins,
and A. Wagoner. The final results
were announced the next day. Syl-
via Hayes was placed as Left
Wing on the All-College Varsity,
and the other five players were
made honorary members to the
All-College Squad. Everyone who
went to the tryouts played better
than ever before, and Bryn Mawr



should be very proud of them all."

Common Room, December 5.—
In discussing “What is the Arab
League Today?”, Cecil Hourani, a
member of the Lebanese delega-
tion to the U.N., presented a com-
prehensive analysis of the original
objectives of the Arab League, its
failure to achieve them, and plans.
for the future.

The League was organized in
1945 in order to bring about unity
of the Middle Eastern countries,
and to strengthen the position of
the Arab nations in the U.N. The
major incentive was “the impend-
ing Palestine situation. The con-
stitution of the League did not
provide for limitation of sover-
eignty of the member states, but
the implicit idea was that event-
ually a unified super-state would
result,

Mr. Hourani. stressed the fact
that “the outcome of the Palestine
problem was of vital importance
to the League.” Its inability to
solve this problem satisfactorily
led to the “prevailing view among
thinking Arabs of the moment that
the League has failed.”

The underlying” causes of this
failure, Mr. \Hourani explained,
were first, the\lack of a permanent
secretariat, and second, ‘their pre-
occupation with purely political
situations, since, in’ the long run,
their political progress would be
judged on a basis of the social and
economic progress\ they made.”

At present, two major alterna-
tive solutions to the problem of
Arab unification have been offered.
A widely favored suggestion is a
federation of those countries
known as the “Fertile Crescent’
. - « Iraq, Syria,, Lebanon, Trans-
jordan, and Arab Palestine. The
other proposal, “Collective Secur-
ity”, calls for a loose alliance of
Arab. States, and abandons the
idea of eventual unity."

“Bring Out Your Dead”
Shows Philadelphia
In Plague’s Grip
by Nina Cave, ’50



Bring Out Your Dead, by J. H.
Powell, is the story of Philadel-
phia’s great yellow fever epidem-
ic in 1793. The book gives a re-
alistic picture not only of the dis-
ease itself, but more important, of
what it did to Philadelphia’s cit-
izenry and institutions.

The central character of the
story is Dr. Benjamin Rush, the
first important physician in Amer-
ican medical history. Dr. Rush al-
most destroys himself in a deter-
mined battle to defend his method
of curing the disease against that
of a group of immigrant French-
men. He stubbornly refuses to ad-
mit that he kills more men than he
cures and¢’though today medical
science completely disagrees with
him, Dr. Powell delivers no judg-
ment on the struggle. Rush never
achieves much liveliness as a per-
sonality, but the narrative of his
experiences is interesting and
sometimes exciting.

The course of the disease is
dealt with very fully; its outbreak
in the terrible heat of a late sum-
mer in Philadelphia; the apvalling
number of deaths as it reaches its
height in mid-October; and finally,
its abatement with the first frost

LAST NIGHTERS

New Giraudoux Comedy
Has World: Premiere
In Philadelphia

Specially contributed by
Katousha Cheremedeff ’52

In the dazzling excitement of a-

premiere on this continent, “The
Enchanted,” by Jean Giraudoux,

opened in Philadelphia on Janu-
ary second. “The Enchanted” was
adapted to the American scene by
Maurice Valency, already known
to some of us by his unforgettable
rendition of “The Madwoman of
Chaillot.”

A myriad of talents gathered
together to present to the public
this new three-act comedy. George
S. Kaufman staged the produc-
tion; Francis Poulenc wrote the
score for the background and
dance music; and Jean Erdman
was the choreographer for the lit-
tle girls’ dance.

The action takes place in a lit-
tle provincial French town at the
turn of this century. The inspec-
tor (Malcolm Keen) has just ar-
rived. A strong ghost, presum-
ably a young man who, after mur-
dering his wife and friends in the
nearby chateau, committed  sui-
cide, is wandering around the
countryside. His presence is mani-
fested through unheard of prece-
dents. At the town’s latest lot-
tery, it was not the mother su-
perior of the convent who won
the motorcycle, but the poor

iyoung man who needed ‘it most;

and the “gros lot” did not go to
Monsieur Dumas, the millionaire,
but to the neediest couple in
town,

The action of the play lingers

between life and death and cen-

Isabel

ters around the heroine,
(Leueen MacGrath). She

been trying to bring some good

into the community; but finds her-

‘self opposed by the conservatives:

the inspector, the mayor, and the

‘gossipy inhabitants of the town.

Through the help of the doctor,

she is able to meet the ghost who,
‘she hopes, is going to solve for

her the enigma of her life: Should
she continue t» live and be wit-
ness of her invapability to reform
the world; or should she die and
in company of other ghosts bring
happiness to her native town?

A few weeks after at an inter-
view with Isabel, the ghost (John
Baragrey) confessing his love to
her, brings up the possibility that
he is not what she thinks, and
that he may be very much ALIVE.
At that word two shots are fired
by the public executioners who
had been ordered by the inspec-
tor to kill the ghost; Isabel stands
grief stricken, her back to the au-
dience, and the second act ends
with “the ghost of the so-called
ghost” walking away reminding

Next week the college will be
called upon to vote on chonges in
the Constitution suggested by the
Revisions Cemmittee. One of these
concerns the honor system — the
responsibility of students for the
actions of other students — upon

which depends our whole concept |.

of student self-government. As the
differences in wording of the two
proposals indicate, we must choose
between whether we want this re-
sponsibility to be compulsory or at
the discretion of the individual
student. The present position is
that each of us has a responsibility
to do her best to prevent violations
of the Self-Gov rules. This does
not mean reporting to the Board
but rather the use of influence or
social pressure, in an attempt to
convince and deter from continued
violations,

It has been suggested that this
compulsion indicates lack of faith
in individual integrity and under-
mihes individual responsibility.

It does not seem to me that the
realization that in any community
there will be persons and times
when violating rules seems less
important than our own temporary
impulses is a reflection on the gen-
eral level of integrity. If all of
us always upheld the rules when
we understood the reasons behind
them, we would not have had the
number of smoking violation cases
before the Board in the past few
weeks that there has been. The
use of social pressure, of persua-
sion and discussion, are the high
est kinds of action by which any
group can choose to govern itself;
acts of omission are often as
harmful to the welfare of the
group as are acts of commission.

The rules of the, Self-Govern-
ment Association are necessary if
we are to govern ourselves rather
than be governed by others. They
are necessary if the college is to
maintain its reputation as a place
where a high standard of social
and intellectual conduct is main-
tained. For us to help one another
to preserve that atmosphere is a
duty to ourselves and the college.
The Self-Gov Board is not a group
sitting in judgment on others, ‘but
the group that we ourselves choose
to administer those rules that are
necessary to responsible self-gov.-
ernment. In order to do this, the
Board must be able, not to hope
for, but to demand the sincere co-
operation of every student.

Sincerely yours,
E. J. Goldblatt

MacGregor Deliberates
Christian Faith, Dogma
Continued from Page 1
ercise” in which no one will be-

lieve,

Dr. MacGregor demonstrated
that the church needs its dogmas
to convey its message. “Proposi-
tions which purport dogmas to ex-
hibit or express religious truth
purport also to be allegorical. But
these propositions are fraught with
a peculiar danger, since, unless
their character is fully understood,
they must always appear intoler-
ably dogmatic in the pejorative
sense of this term ... A Christian
dogma is not something less than
a vision; it is something more. It
is a vision half glimmering through
mystery.”

Dr. MacGregor stressed that as
the Christian church rethinks the
nature of its dogmatic affirmations,
“it will become more and more
aware of how much more is im-
plied in Christian faith"

The College News

I wish to join the swelling ranks.
of those who protest against the-
policy of The College News with.
regard to reviews of.dramatic pro-

that the review represents nothing-

as Bryn Mawr’s efforts at self-ex-

I think that the review in last
week’s edition of the production of
King Lear by Princeton’s Theatre-
Intime represents a new low in
criticism. To the best of my un-
derstanding, the play was well re-
ceived at Princeton, but aside from
the question of the merits of the
play, I feel that Bryn Mawr has.
definitely overstepped itself in
panning the production of another
college. We are not, and have.
never been, in any way affiliated.
with any Princeton dramatic or-
ganization and I do not feel that
we have the right to criticize their
efforts. In any such performance,
it would, be well to bear in mind
some of the courtesies which have
been extended to Bryn Mawr by
the various Princeton publications.

their special edition put out last.

Bryn Mawr, it seems more than
underhanded to reciprocate in this.

I personally feel that until the.
College News learns to handle the
reporting of affairs on the Bryn
Mawr campus in a slightly more
adult and less pseudo-New Yorker
manner, it should refrain from:
panning the efforts of another col-
lege in such a purposeless manner.

The Girl with the Deer by Hofer
is not an “etching and dry point’”
but a lithograph as the label on it
says. The Whistler “Seymour” is
an etching and consequently the.
effects described are obtained by
the use of the etching needle and
acid rather than with a pen. The
Durer is not on “parchment” (i,e.
skin) but on paper.

It is not in any attempt to quar-.

of taste when I say that the Haden.

no importance” since it is both a
very pleasant picture and an ex-
cellent sample of the work of one-
of the best of English 19th cen-

Current Events

Common Room, Monday, April
17: Mr. Bachrach spoke on the cur-
rent issue of “McCarthyism”, giv-
ing facts of the case and pointing
out why this subject is so pertin-
ent to all Americans.

‘McCarthy, the 40-year-old sena-
tor from Wisconsin, began his po-
litical career in 1935 as a New-
Dealer. (Reversing his policy in
1939, he ran for circuit judge on
the Republican ticket. When the
Supreme Court was asked to dis-
bar him in 1948 for failing to file
a correct income tax report, it
refused, and the next year Mc-
Carthy went into the U. S. Sen-
ate. s

In a speech made in Wheeling,
W. Va. on Feb. 9, McCarthy said
that the State Department is in-
fested with Communists . As a re-
sult, investigations have been go-
ing on for the past two and a half
months, and McCarthy is still try-
ing to convince his colleagues that
his accusation ig true. Illustrat-
ing, he said that Jessup has an
affinity to Communism, and Mrs.
Acheson spensored a_ subversive
organization, the “League of
Women Shoppers”. However, al-
though McCarthy is basically very
clever, the United States has
been on to him from the begin-
ning, and the newspapers have all
agreed that he is irresponsible, and
cannot keep his facts straight.

Third Round

After the Lattimore affair,
there was no one, with the pos-
sible exception of Hickenlooper,
who would back McCarthy in the
controversy. (Mr. Bachrach re-
marked that it is amazing how
Americans can tolerate this sort of
thing from a man who is unable to
back up his statements.

Now McCarthy says that he is
in his “third round”, and that
Budenz’s testimony Thursday will
prove his case. Still the people
wait, noted Mr. Bachrach, and if a
strong testimony is produced by
this witness against Lattimore and
the State Department, the Repub-
licans will have a campaign issue.

Much _dependson . this one
man for three reasons, which are
underlying factors in the case.
First, McCarthy has been tolerated
by some Republicans and Demo-
crats because they want to get
Secretary of State Acheson out of
office. In addition, the question of
bi-partisan foreign policy is in-
volved. From a political aspect,
too, the Republicans need an issue
for the next election, and this con-
troversy can provide them with
material.

In conclusion, Mr. Bachrach
stated that the important point in
Lattimore’s testimony is that a
sure way to jeopardize freedom of
speech: in the United States ig to
have people making this kind of
unfounded attack on others’ repu-
tations, with impunity; for those
who might disagree fear similar
attacks on themselves,

have long deplored the lack of creative opportunities at Bryn
Mawr. In response to student demand they have grown: we
have the College Theatre, Freshman and Junior shows, Coun-

Night, which presents what may be the most challenging and
rewarding opportunities.

But this year’s response has been discouraging in two
ways. First, from the creative aspect; dancers and musicians
have responded to the call of Arts Night, but Bryn Mawr is

not represented by a play. Those connected with Arts Night
have talent and great enthusiasm, but their number is not
proportionately representative of the many creative and
highly talented students on the Bryn Mawr campus.

Second, a glance at the seating chart will indicate the
apathy of the student body. Unless a great many tickets are
sold at the door, the auditorium will be less than half full.
The Arts Night committee was pleased to be able to present
its entertainment in Goodhart this year—an innovation and

her own choreography, which was

NEWS:

I found the review of the Arts
Night Dance Production disap-
pointing and misleading. Although
it seemed to have been written sin-
cerely and _ conscientiously and
each dance was analyzed thought-
fully, it failed to convey the “lift”

that one had in viewing a success-
ful performance. I feel sorry ,for
the ‘reviewer if the first dance
seemed too complicated for her to
understand, ‘but I: question -wheth-
er she has the right to give the im-
pression to the large number of

that they were, merely “the sort
of thing the dance club should be
doing.” And if her judgment is to
be harsh, I believe that she should
not allow herself to be uneven in
her judgment.

For instance, her decision that
the Death of a Marionette was
successful and Marche Slave was
not, seemed dictated largely by her
indulgent attitude in regard to the
former and her rigid intolerance
in regard to the latter. It is high-
ly debateably whether comedy en-
ables. the artist to laugh off his
mistakes as if he intended to make
them . An artist performs at all
times with purpose and authority.
Originality of choreography can
be greatly marred by indecision of
movement and inconsistency of
concept. On the other hand, lack
of originality can be considerably

and projection of mood.
‘Originality Not Essential

I believe that the audience could
feel and enjoy the technical skill
and the serious concentration of
the dancers in Marche Slave, with-
out craving originality and novel
gesture. i

As for the reviewer’s criticism
of Rhapsody on a Windy Night, I
am amazed at her preoccupation
,with the “embarrassingly poor”
‘parts. Why does she attack the
inexperienced male dancers? Their
presence in the dance represents a
step toward a more complete real-~
ization of the possibilities of dance
composition, and I felt that they
performed with vigor and sincer-
ity. It is natural for spectators to
disagree with the choreographers.
in some respects, but her critical
reaction seemed to prevent her
from feeling that the dance as. a
whole was an exciting and success-
ful affair.

If she ¢hooses- to dissect the
dance rather than take it as a.
whole, ought she not be sure of her:
facts? She is right when she says.
that| more than a small part of a
dance’s success depends upon the
feeling within the dancer herself,
but I think she should make it
| clear that although this feeling-
will inevitably show in the facial
expression, the dancer aims to
translate her feeling into the lan-
guage of movement, of which the
facial muscles are a very small
part.



Need for Comprehensive Crew

And what is the reviewer’s auth--
ority for her outline of the best.
procedure of composing a dance?
Is she reviewing the end result.
with a freshness of vision or has.
she delved into the process of com-
position and decided on her own
how a dance should be composed ?
There is no rule about the number
of choreographers. The best pro-.-
cedure for adapting the music to.
the dance has not been decided
upon, but it is generally conceded
that the dance should be given pri-.
ed as an accompaniment after the:

problems in public relations and
mentioned techniques that would
help publicity. First of all, he said,
our “blue-stocking reputation is
not a passport to survival,” and
the gap between reputation and
reality must be stressed. “(At
present) Bryn Mawr has a highly
private place in the rear rank of
public relations.” In addition, the
older colleges are handicapped by
living within themselves. They
must send out representatives, and
so rid themselves of provincialism.
For this reason, the president, sym-
bol of the college, is called wpon
for great numbers of speeches.
Members of the Seven College
Conference, too, are relatively con-
tent with their status, and academic
adventure and freshness is some-
times weighed down by past repu-
tation.

The colleges should cease to feel
that if they do a good job of teach-
ing the publicity will take care of
itself. Pictures are usually more
appealing than stories. In addition,
colleges can belong to the Ameri-
can Public Relations Association.
and in discussing their problems,
profit by the experience of others.
Co-operation with the press, and a
systematic release of news can
often keep unfavorable publicity
from the front pages. The entire
pressure of the public relations
work must not fall on the presi-
dent. Instead, if Bryn Mawr is to
know and become known to the
public, there mu rm writing

Avirett told of the techniques avail-
able for making known the story
of Bryn Mawr, he pointed out that
the college “must make its con-
tribution to the general public
known in order to be allowed to
continue to make that contribu-
tion.”"

The Executive Board of the
Self - Government Association has
discussed your editorial of October
25. We are grateful to the NEWS
for bringing up the question of
unescorted “Bar Hopping’; how-
ever, we feel that the situation is
not as confusing, serious, or wide-
spread as the editorial suggests.

Our policy is stated in the Con-
stitution:

“Cases of intoxication will be
severely dealt with.”

“Any case which the Execu-

tive Board considers to have
brought discredit on the college
shall be severely dealt with.”
It is imypossible and unnecessary
to list every situation which might
bring discredit on the college; it is
equally impossible and unneces-
sary to list rules to cover each
situation.

Every fall when freshmen ask if
girls who are under age may sign
cut to bars, Self-Government re-
plies: (a) the State Law says that
no minor may enter or be served
in a bar; (b) however, if a minor
breaks the law on her own respon-
sibility, she must sign out correct-
ly; (c) the discretionary function
of the student enters the picture
here.

After all, the Self-Government
Association is based on the as-
sumption that people of college
age are mature enough to make
their own decisions.

We agree with the NHWS that
the question of “Bar Hopping”
cannot be settled by a definite rule.
It can be answered only by the in-
dividual’s discretion. Exertion of
social pressure in cases of intoxi-
eation, as in everything else, is up
to the individual student. Accord-_
ing to the recent revisions, the use
ofthis social pressure cannot be
judged by anyone.

It is out of the range of the
Sebf Government Association to
regulate ‘the . decision of students
in going to bars, but if a student

‘We would like to present our
case against “Middle Size May

new life into an old tradition. The

plan suggested was to celebrate
May Day on a Saturday and to
lengthen the ceremonies until the
middle of the afternoon, when the
Sophomore ‘Carnival| would be
held. This would be followed in
the evening by Arts Night and a
hall dance. ‘We feel this plan is
defeating its own purpose. Sopho-
more Carnival was originated to
fill in the Saturday afternoon gap
in Junior Prom Weekend. We don’t
think that anyone goes to Sopho-
more Carnival unless they have
dates, and very few people will
ask men down to May Day. There-
fore, in depriving Junior Prom
weekend of the Sophomore Carni-
val, we are creating two small
weekends instead of one big one.
Middle Size May Day would not
be a traditional college function,
and much less a means of uniting
the student body.

Instead of this we would like to
suggest that Sophomore Carnival
remain on Junior Prom Weekend,

that May Day be lengthened as).

planned, and the two or three
hours left vacant by Sophomore
Carnival be given over to inter-
class sports and hall open house
teas. (Also, that Arts Night and
a hall dance be held in the eve-
ning. In this way the spirit of
May Day as a traditional college
function will be preserved, more

people will be on campus to take |
part in it, Arts Night will benefit

from a larger audience and a hall

Writers Feel May Day
Does Not Mix
With Dates

December 4, 1950
The Editor College News
Bryn Mawr College
Dear Editor:

It may be that approaching old
age inclines us to be reactionary,
but it seems to us that adequate
reasons have not been presented
for breaking with what we consid-
er a very nice, if somewhat damp,
tradition. As Seniors we have
looked foyward to being wakened
‘by the Sophomores early on May
_Day morning and would gladly, if
grumblingly, emerge at dawn to
Sing to the Son in the rain. We
)agree that 5:30 a. m. is an early
hour and not one acceptable for
daily rising, but it really is not
such a hardship if you consider it
as a once-a-year proposition.



- To break up the order of events
of May Day and to insert activi-
ties which have always had a
place of their own on the College
Calendar, such as Arts Night and
Sophomore Carnival, seems to de-
tract from the spirit of May Day.
May Day is an end in itself—it
lends an atmosphere of general
good feeling. (Middle-sized May
Day is to be an attempt to unify
the undergraduate body, but mak-
ing it a social affair is defeating
this purpose. How many of us are
going to be able to relax and en-
joy a leisurely breakfast with our
class if we are worrying about
our dates missing trains and what
dress to wear? How many Sen-
iors are going to want to distrib-
ute May Day sticks and hoops on
Saturday if they have a date to
entertain, and how many under-
classmen will show real pleasure
at receiving them if they are sim-
ilarly occupied?

It sems to us that this compro-
mise will take away one of the
nicest traditions at Bryn Mawr.
The advantages of Middle-sized
May Day are few compared to its
disadvantages, especially that of
the loss of a definite spirit which
belongs to May Day as we know it.

We want Middle-size May Day!

We would be pleased to invite
men to an all college weekend
planned around May Day. Why
‘would they be any more uncomfort-
able at May Day Rites than animal
hunting? It would be a relief to
have a full weekend to offer. We
believe that men will enjoy all the
activities, especially the Sophomore
Carnival and Arts Night which in
turn will gain from their associa-
tion with May Day. Junior Prom
as a formal dance doesn’t have to
suffer in any way when Sophomore
Carnival is moved, witness the at-

|tendance at the fall Undergrad

dances.

There has been criticism of hav-
ing May Day on Saturday; we are
very much in favor of having it on
a weekend.

1. At little May Day we are just
getting in the mood when the ten
o’clock bell rings fior classes.

2. Classes are completely wasted
on that day ‘because everyone is
exhausted.

3. Considering the amount of

-| work put into little May Day in

dancing, singing, etc., middle-size
May Day would not envolve any
more work except for those who
are interested, and the dancing
would be appreciated by more
people. —

The main point is the college uni-
fication which we feel would re-
sult from the various activities and
which is now lacking at little May
Day.

Sincerely yours,
Jane Walker, ’51

ditional little May Day would break

when she said, “you may not take
another in my stead.” When Ido-
neus awoke, it was the morning
of his wedding day. With all his
friends gathered around, he drank
a toast to the statue, and said,
“turn on us, goddess, your cold
marble face,” whereupon the statue
fell and shattered to the ground,
with the ring still tight on her
hand. Mr. Carpenter ends the tale
by saying that the statue fell on
Idoneus.

The second legend, “The Beget-
ting and Strange Fate of Merlin,”
is divided into two parts. Because
the devil was summoned to create
an anti-Christ, he singled out a
prosperous man and killed him and

his family. But one daughter}. .

escaped. She came in contact with
a lute player wearing nothing but
red shoes, and he asked her to join
him in paradise. So, although the

The station is dependent not only on student support,

but on student suggestion as well. Interest and enthusiasm
for this new project have developed in past weeks; if they
should decline under the pressures of routine and of time
limitations, the scope of the radio station must decline cor-
respondingly. Despite the fact that its broadcasting facili-
ties are cramped, WBMC is coming into existence as a posi-
tive entity. It must rely on the college for its continuation
on a positive basis. All those responsible for the station’s
survival should be commended for the interest and effort
they have contributed; they deserve the hearty support of

shoes, and played the harp. Thus
was Merlin born.

In the second section we find

‘a discussion among the witches,

for they are disturbed that Merlin
is “doomed to die a Christian.” De-
ciding to bring him home among
the demons, Satan asked who
should be sent to retrieve him;
Nimue, the beautiful woman, was
decided upon, and she appeared in
a glorious flash, all enflamed.

While Merlin was walking in the
woods, a shadow crossed his path,
and he looked to discover this beau-
tiful woman, clad only in a golden
girdle.

She then went back to the castle
with him, saying, “no devil can
take a man that God has helped.
- man must destroy himself.”
So she tempted him to show her
his magic tricks, and finally won
him over, offered her body in re-
turn. At last she learned the trea-
sured trick, that of burying a buzz-
ing fly in amber. While Merlin
slept, she worked the same spell
on him, and after shrieking in
“rage, anguish, and despair,” he
was silent. “He lies imprisoned in
his hollow hill,” like the fly in
amber. In conclusion to this story,
Mr. Carpenter asserted that “even
I who made these lines” talked
with Merlin.

The verses were written in iam-
bie pentameter, and contained ele-
ments of the dramatic, and of sus-
pense, brought out in the soft,
pleasant tones of the reader’s voice.
By his choice of words, his clarity,
and his intonations, Mr. Carpenter
captivated the audience, and left
them with trance-like expressions,
silent for the moment, before the
outburst of enthusiastic applause."

(Re: The last issue of THE COL-
LEGE NEWS, February 21, 1951.

“the dread of war—forgotten
for some ten years” (Page 2, col.
1) is a generalization which does
not hold true. The attack on Pearl
Harbor took place December 7,
1941. ‘Since then, dread of war has
at no time been absent from any-
one’s mind. Even if qualified with
the adjective ‘impending’, the state-
ment would not be justified.

The headline, “Schulberg’s: New
Novel Gives Fitzgerald True
Depth”, (Page 3, col. 5) is com-
pletely untrue, inasmuch as the en-
tire review points to the fact that
the book is superficial.

One cannot speak, “loudly: sotto
voice” (‘Page 8, col. 4)—and it is
‘voce’ in any case. “Donuts” (Page
8, col. 4) is “doughnuts”. “Males-
On-Campus” (Page 3, col. 4), un-
like sons-in-law, is not hyphenat-
ed. (No such adjective exists as
“prepondering” (Page 1, col. 3).
On Page 5, col. 5, is “Passionate
but Pleasant” a parallel?

‘With the exception of “Bard’s
Eye View”, Pages six, seven, and
eight contain no articles which are
not continuations from previous
pages. I wonder if the makeup ar-
rangement might not be varied to
sustain reader interest.



‘The Observer’, originally intro-
,duced to provide variety in an oth-
erwise strictly journalistic venture
has degenerated into obvious week-
ly “filler” material. And when
THE NEWS finds it necessary to
| print two such rambling, pseudo-
impressionistic pieces in one issue,
perhaps the staff might take a
step in the opposite direction and
compress, limiting THE NEWS to
fewer pages and less persiflage.
These criticisms have been
prompted by an honest wish to see
a better COLLEGE NEWS.
Sincerely,
Joanna Semel, ’52



Assembly's Movie._|

Once Aided Frosh

The Bryn Mawr movie was made
five years ago to inspire sub-
freshmen; now you giggle at the
short skirts and _ self-conscious
posing. But many more under-
graduates than usual came to this
morning’s assembly — possibly to
jeer, maybe to take pride.

You recognized.people in the film
with a gasp of happy surprise; you
felt that all this enthusiasm for
the library was overdone. But
Taylor Tower photographed
through flowering trees, and the
serene Cloisters struck you with
timeless beauty. Mr. Herben teach-
ing Survey, Mr. Naum discussing
philosophy, Mr. Sloane with slides
—none of these were ludicrous. It
was only the student life which
seemed dated and awkward.

As you left the assembly, you
might have wished, “Why don’t
they take the best of the old and
make a new Bryn Mawr movie?”

The Editorial of the pre-election
week NEWS stresses the responsi-
bility of the student body in the
matter of College elections. It
seems that the NEWS is not set-
ting an example to the student
body and is shirking its responsi-
bility as a reliable source of in-
formation on campus. ‘The NEWS
has no less than six staff photog-
raphers and this year, for the first
time, there are no pictures of can-
didates for major offices, while
John K. Fairbank merits a photo-
graph. The photographs of can-
didates serve an important part in
identifying names with actual
people, which is especially helpful
to underclassmen.

Furthermore, the listing of can-.
didates for Self-Gov., Undergrad.,
and the League seems to indicate
that the NEWS does not consider
these office important enough to
have them listed in prominent
positions. One has to search for
the nominations for President of
the League, while Self-Gov. and
Undergrad. candidates are placed
underneath less important offices.

It is a pity that the NEWS has
not been able to live up to the
standards suggested by its edi-
torial.

Sincerely,
Marianne Klein, ’51



The NEWS wishes to defend it-
self on several points mentioned
in this letter. First: the slate of
four candidates for Self-Gov. Pres-
ident was not known until 8 p. m.
Monday. In order to have pictures
in the COLLEGE NEWS, cuts of
the photographs must be made.
The last possible mail by which
photos may be sent special delivery
to the engravers is the early Mon-
day morning mail. Even though
the Monday evening mail seemed
much too late to send out the Self-
Gov. nominees’ photographs, the
NEWS, on an outside chance, sent
them anyhow, having them mailed
in Philadelphia. The cuts did not
arrive at the printers as expected
on Wednesday, and room had been
left for them at tht top of page 38.

The spaces where the Self-Gov.
pictures should have been were fill-
ed with sophomore candidate infor-
mation. The only space that could
be left for the League nominations
was at the bottom of the page. To
the best of the NEWS’ knowledge,
this election reporting is the most
up-to-the-minute that has been
done in recent years.

Results of voting on Tuesday, of
course, were not revealed in time
to have cuts made. The slates of
eight were not revealed until the
class meetings. It was therefore,
impossible to send in pictures ahead
of: time of the eight, and use
whichever four won. Also, the ex-
pense of throwing away four cuts
per office is more than the NEWS
can bear.

This difficulty with photographs
is minor compared to the difficulty
of obtaining finished photographs.
If special photographs have to be
taken — as is practically always
true of the general run of NEWS
photographs—it takes at the very
least twenty-four hours to get the
film developed before mailing.

The NEWS appreciates Mari-
anne’s letter because it provides
the opportunity for an explanation
of why, sometimes, the NEWS does
not have the pictures its readers
would like to see. It also demon-"

NEWS:

Your editorial on the shortcom-
ings of the Bryn Mawr faculty as
lecturers raises a general question
which has agitated the breasts of
educational reformers for the last
forty years, caused President Mei-
klejohn to start the experimental
college at the University of /Wis-
consin, and Bennington College to
open its doors: namely, how can
American colleges more effectively
fulfill their function of spreading
some awareness of our intellectual
heritage to incoming generations
of students. I hope the editors of
the College NEWS will forgive me
for saying that I think they have
begun at the wrong end of the lad-
der by identifying good teaching
with effective lectures. To do so
is, in my mind, to lose the battle
before it has even been joined.
After sitting for twenty-five years
on committees searching for out-
side lecturers on academic subjects
whose performance could be 100%
guaranteed, I have become con-
vinced that they are as rare as
first rate actors or first rate prima
donnas. Most of us can now and
again become eloquent or witty on
a favorite topic, but to expect that
we shall all be able to repeat the
performance six or eight times a
week until we retire is a council
of perfection scarcely to be real-
ized on this planet.

Perhaps the basic fallacy in your
argument is in assuming that good
teaching is ever a one-sided affair.
The best classroom performance
will prove sterile unless the stu-
dents have some idea what they are
looking for in a college course and
are vocal in demanding it in and
out of class. The crux of the ques-
tion, as I see it, was raised two
years ago in a meeting of the
social science departments when
one of the younger members of
the faculty said, “Why are fresh-
men at Bryn Mawr so eager to ask
questions and explore avenues
which have been opened; why does
that zest disappear when they re-
turn to the campus as_ soph-
omores ?”

The answer to that question is

contribution to human life.” God
who “set eternity in the heart of

man” would not let him be content

to be a bit of mechanism, but set

in him a creative force which

makes thim strive for truth, good-
ness, and’ beauty. God, “the mov-
er towards personalization”; put a
“moral imperative upon man to be
the highest type of person his
mind can conceive.”

The obstacles to attaining this
goal, Dr. Horton continued, come
under the heading, the “principle
of restraint.” Because of this en-
emy, man becomes an easy victim
to the spirit of his times, and is
made to conform in a society jeal-
ous of all dissenters. The predic-
ament af a businessman trying to
be “generous in an ungenerous
world” was cited as an example of
man’s losing his meaning as an in-
dividual in society. ‘When this hap-
pens, the need for God in order to

find: the answer to the process of |

life becomes stronger than ever.
dn conclusion, Dr. Horton said
that the church is a place where
man’s convictions are sustained,
and where a “fragment of God’s
eternal purpose is held out to
man.” The church gives man hope,
and shows him that “life is worth’
living, even if it is very difficult.”

‘merely suggestive of the situation. Last week’s four-page
‘issue was indeed “pared to the bone,” but the criticism it has
received is no more valid than the reason which necessitated
its brevity.

The NEWS is one of the two self-supporting newspapers

issued in private women’s colleges in the United States. It
‘receives no subsidies from the College administration or stu-
‘dent body, and is paid for solely by subscriptions and adver-
tising. And Bryn Mawr is the only one of the “Big Seven”
colleges where en to the student paper is not man-
datory.
At the beginning of the second eemester, the NEWS pro-
vided journalistic bills of fare which were overly rich in
write-ups of events off-campus, feature articles, and cuts.
This was done in the interest of publishing a paper which
would have a wider scope, and balance news reports with cre-
ative writing, but without sufficient attention to financial
limitations. NEWS funds might now be compared to the al-
lowance which is spent by the fifteenth of the month, or,
more appropriately, to the national budget. The NEWS is
now running on a program of deficit spending.
There is only one possible solution to this problem: the
‘NEWS must restrict iteelf to four-page issues for the re-
‘mainder of the semester, which will necessitate considerable
curtailment of subject matter and coverage. Comprehension
of earlier errors cannot rectify them, but they can be amend-
. ed. Because it is the newspaper of the College, the NEWS
believes that it is only just to explain to the College the rea-
sons which have made this austerity program necessary.

It seems advisable to correct an
error in last week’s NEWS, which
said that ‘Arts Night had been a
custom since 1949. Even within
the memory of an undergraduate
it is possible to probe more deeply
than that. The first Arts Night
was, of course, in 1947, but that
does not fall within my memory.
In 1948 the second Arts Night had
as its theme “Encounter,” around
which all the varying media cen-
tered their expression. The mem-
orable feature of that program
was the extraordinary “Each Man
is an Island,” a dance with music
composed by Sperry Lea and chor-
eographed by (Marjorie Low. I
still remember it as the most suc-
cessful undergraduate composition
to come from Bryn Mawr in my
years here.

At the time of writing I have nu
memory of Arts Night (1949, nor
any access to records of it. ‘At
that time, however, the idea of a
central theme for Arts Night was
beginning to break down and en-
thusiasm was being lost. Last year
an importation from Princeton, su-
verbly executed, put everything lo-
cal to shame, despite the efforts of
Sperry ‘Lea and the Dance Club in
“Rhapsody on a Windy Night.”
This year enthusiasm is at its low-
est, and Arts Night has been
shunted off to the Skinner Work-
shop. Perhaps in the future we
may look for more contributions
and greater time spent in the
preparation of this fine annual
custom.

teaching with any relation to the
contemporary world in its  en-
tirety, and on the opposite line of
argument teaching is found to
absorb too much of the time of
a “valuable research man”. The
controversy is natural, especially
because of the problems of in-
creased size which are involved—
greatly expanded fields of study,
rapid production of young profes-
sors, greatly increased numbers
of students. Bryn Mawr has a
unique position in this controversy
for it is the institution in the
country most definitely committed
to the point of view that teaching
and research not only supplement
but enrich each other.

“It is not necessary here to il-
lustrate ways in which this pro-
cess works. [Illustrations as a
matter of fact may come to some
of you in your first class. Nor
would it be worth while to spend
any time denying the negative—
that teaching and research are not
sometimes antithetical! I am
more interested in pointing out
the fact, as I see it, that absorp-
tion in this dichotomy has led to
neglect of a third function of the
university or college. This third
function is recognized at Bryn
Mawr, if not always explicitly, but
its importance is such in relation
to existing stresses in the world
that it should be clearly recog-
nized. The third function is the
progress in thought that goes on

through whatever kinds of forum |

the college finds it convenient to

provide, whatever kinds of meet- |

ing formal or informal the mem-
bers of the college happen upon.
The important thing is not the
kind of meeting but the fact that
there is opportunity for easy
meeting.

“This is something other than
research in the sense of group or
individual study systematically
pursued according to  predeter-
mined design. It is not teaching
in the sense of communication be-
tween the two groups of faculty
and students only. This important
function of the university or col-
lege that is missed in the teach-
ing versus research controversy is
communication in a wider sense,
all the exchange of opinion that
goes on among members of an
academic community—if it has the
good fortune to be a community.”

League Clarifies

Functions at Tea

Since this is “Know Your
League Year”, the questions to
ask yourself are “What Does the
League Do” and “What Can I Do
For the League?” These ques-
tions were answered for those
students who attended the cider
and doughnuts party given by the
League on Monday, October 8ta.
All freshmen and upperclassmen
who were interested in helping
others, in fields ranging from
Reading for the Blind to scooping
ice cream cones in the Soda Foun-
tain, found their services were
needed.

In every branch of the League
more people are needed, in turn,
to help those who need the
League. To answer the questions
of those people who have not yet
decided in what way they would
like to serve, there is a League
representative in each hall. The
best way to find out the “why”
and “how” of the League is to go
into action yourself.

Miss Leighton opened the cur-

on the Japanese Peace Treaty
which was signed in San Francisco
on September 8. Viewed in the
perspective of the western powers’
objectives in the Pacific, the treaty
was part of a larger plan 1) to
up Japan as a_ bulwark
against Communism in the Far
East, and 2) to erect a defense
against renewed Japanese aggres:
sion. The general principles of the
Treaty were voiced by Mr. Dulles
last March. First, the peace should
restore Japan as an equal in the
‘society of nations. Second, it
should give Japan a chance to be-
come self-sustaining in the world,
Third, it should encourage close
cultural relations between Japan
and the West, and finally it should
give Japan:'a reasonable security.

The Cause Is Just

With the beginning of the college year comes, along
with the arranging of schedules, and assuming extra-curric-
ular responsibilities, a plea for funds. Under the last cate-
gory, the United Service Fund is one of the prime considera-
tions presented to the student body. It is not fair to be ask-
ed to give without knowing why or to what you are giving.
With this in mind, the United Service Fund Committee calls
a meeting of the college Legislature to allocate the funds to
the proper channels, and promulgates the results to the stu-
dents at large.

From the experience of past years of giving and from in-
formation received by the chairman of the USF committee
about worthwhile causes to which student aid should be giv-
en, the Legislature votes on the percentages allotted to the
various charities. Among these is the “Needy College Fund”,
a comparatively new charity, which seeks, independently of
the Care for Books, to help those universities abroad most
devastated by the results of the last war, as well as colleges
at home in dire need of aid. The institutions selected this
year are Tsuda University, Japan, Hiroshima University,
Japan, Athens College, Greece, and the United Negro College
Fund which helps Negro colleges all over the United States.

The reserve fund is an especially important part of the"

We feel that in the event of a
disaster the college should not be
obliged to evacuate a large num-
ber of useless students. For this
reason, it is imperative that as
many students as possible take,
if not the eighty-hour, at least the
sixteen-hour Nurse’s Aide course.

It is our observation that the
5 o’clock to 6 o’clock meetings of
extracurricular activities conflict
with these courses. We therefore
suggest that such extracurricular
activities be re-scheduled, since
we believe that many potentially
useful people are prevented from
taking the Nurse’s Aide course
only by their previous extradite |
ricular commitments. It is of
course evident that in event of an
emergency no extracurricular or-
ganization will be of the slightest!
importance.

the Freshman Hall plays, namely,
the lack of any mention of the

Talent and Art
In ““Joe”’

To the Editor:

I should like to express my sur-
prise at the fact that no acknowl-
edgement was given by the judges
of the freshman hall plays to Mer-
ion’s ‘excellently produced “Joe”.
It is easy to comprehend their dif-
ficulties in the face of so much as-
sembled talent as appeared in
those two nights, and yet it seems
a pity that so splendid a play
should have been apparently over-
looked.

Perhaps this play suffered in the!
eyes of the judges for not being
one of those plays we have always
been curious to see. It was cer-
tainly a risky and difficult script
and a challenge that a less gifted
group might well have stumbled
on. This fact in itself should be
to the credit of the performers, at
least three of whom were superb.
There was, I felt, a sincerity and
polish in the acting, which is, so
far-as I can remember, unprece-
dented in a freshman play. The
direction was good, simple, and
strongly moving. The staging, al-
though it was not tricky or com-
plicated, was in complete harmony
with the production, and there
was, in addition to the beautiful
lighting at the end, that supreme
blessing of good visibility through-
out the performance. This com-
bined effect of effort and talent
produced a play of great merit in
itself, and one that fulfilled in the
highest degree the standards on
which these freshman plays should
be judged.

Miss Robbins Analyzes
Elections Held
In England

Current Events, Common Room,
October 29, 7:15 p.m. Miss Rob-
bins analyzed the significance cf
the British elections, which took
place on. October 25, Although all
of the votes have not been count-
ed, the Conservatives have won the
election by a narrow majority
with 320 seats, which represents
only fortyeight per cent of the
electoral vote. Labour has 293
seats and forty-nine per cent of
the electoral vote, while the Lib-
erals have only five seats and two

‘per cent of the electoral vote.

Miss Robbins doubts that the
split in the labour party between
Bevan and Atlee before the elec-
tion seriously diminished the La-
bour vote. At the party meeting
in Stockpot last month Bevan
was favoured over Atlee. Bevan,
“the Taft of the Labour party,”
want to avoid gontinental involve-
ments, fears embroilment in a
world wide conflict, and endorses
furthering the social welfare pro-
gram. He is anti-American and
an isolationist. If he choses,
Bevan will be capable of leading
vigorous opposition to the Con-
servatives.

It is probable that in most dis-
tricts it was the tranfer of Lib-
eral vote to the Conservatives
that put the latter into power.
Liberal support was due partly to
dissatisfaction, primarily dco-
nomic, with the present govern-
ment and partly to agreement
with the program stated by David
Eccles and Anthony Eden, who
announced that the “main task at
home is to build social and eco-
nomic freedom.” The Eccles
manifesto disclaimed any policy
to bring about an economy of un-
trammelled free enterprise or any
attempt to undo the achievements
of the welfare state. He did, how-
ever, advocate the reintroduction
of the profit motive and personal
incentive, as well as the elimina-
tion of objectionable bureaucracy
in the nationalized industries by
reorganization on a more local
scale and extensive economic re-
On foreign policy, in cor-
trast to Bevan, Churchill came

out for cooperation with the con-

tinent and more vigorous British
participation in foreign affairs.

It remains to be seen if, with a
narrow margin and stiff opposi-
tion, the Conservatives can carry
their program through, The eco-
nomic crisis promises to be the
most trying problem, while the
discomfort of domestic shortages
may cause serious dissatisfaction
with the government, particularly
among the Labour unions.

Dr. Brandt again proved these
philosophers wrong by applying
the Empirical Assertion Theory,

and occasionally the editor had
dreams on the editorial page. In
looking backward and taking into
account the more modern time,
there is no appreciable change in
the attitude of the Bryn Mawr
girl then and now. She is still a
fervent defender of her rights as
an individual, and yet stands up
for Bryn Mawr to the outside. She
was then as now, interested in the
organizations on campus’ and
fought bitterly over the issue of
Big or Little May day. She hated
the orals and feared the trend
away from the classics; she cut
chapel and worried ahout whether
Bryn Mawr girls were snobbish.

on the founding of the League

accent is on attending the func-

the busiest time of the year for

out.’”” But if the News caused con-

both sides, and “All the Board
were hockey players, and so very
fair-minded about things.”

Bryn Mawr College News

The Library Council question-
naire, the recent editorial in the
News, and the suggestions placed
in the box in the Reserve Room
have raised again the question of
an Open versus a Closed Reserve
Room. The success of our present
system depends entirely upon the
complete cooperation of those who
use the Reserve Room. I am con-
vinced that all of the trouble aris-
es from the actions of a very few
who selfishly put their own needs
above any curtailing rules. The
majority of the students are hon-
orable and careful to observe Lib-
rary regulations.

However, there are a number of
small ways in which many stud-
ents are thoughtless in their use
of the Library. It might be well
at this time to consider ways in
which we may all need to reform.
In sending these suggestions to
the News I should like to point out
that I am not bypassing the ex-
cellent Library Council but am
doing so with its complete ap-
proval.

1. The Reserve Rooms and the
steps leading to the Reading Room
are not places for gossip.

2. Library assistants working in
the Reserve Room do not know as-
signments in various courses, In
order to locate books on reserve,
they must know author and title.
Students are urged to pay careful
attention when the assignment is
given.

3. The Reserve Room is not a
source of supply for pencils. As
many as six have disappeared in
one week. This may be listed un-
der the title of petty annoyances!

4. The Library assistant will be
glad to locate long cards which are
filed and does not enjoy having
others . shuffle through them or
grab out a while batch of 800s for
example. ‘Nor does she want cards
refiled by others than herself since
they are often or even regularly
misfiled. Cards which have been
rem«-ved for resigning or reserva-
tions should be placed in the
square brown box.

5. Since the rules for the use
of the Reserve Room may change
from year to year or may become

more specific, it is highly recom-

mended that even the most ex-
perienced users of the Reserve
Room read each year the current
rules which are always on the
bulletin board. It is disconcert-
ing to be met with blank looks
when reminding students. that
only one book may be used at a
time in the Reading Room and



that overnight books may not go
out until 9:30. Incidentally books
reserved for the night may not
go out until 9:50 if in use at 9:30.
Students should also be sure to
consult the Reserve sheet before
going off blithely with books for
the night.

6. In the Reading Room Re-
serve Desks are available for
Seniors. Official Reserve Desk
signs may be obtained at the Main
Circulation desk. Students are
urged to keep their desks tidy and
undecorated.

7. I should like to enter a
strong plea that students show
consideration for the needs of
their fellow students in reserving
books. The week-end before a
quiz is no time to take a book out
for the week-end. Nor is it neces-
sary to reserve several copies of
the same book at different hours
during the day thus insuring a
steady use of the book at a time
when the book is at a premium.
Some students forget that only
one book per course may be re-
served for the night though sev-
eral books may be taken if not
previously reserved. In regard
to week-end reservations it would
be considerate to reserve the boox
for Saturday night only and only
sign it out for the week-end if on
Saturday night it has not been
reserved for the Sunday hours.

In closing I should like to point
out that the so-called disagreeable
Library rules are made to insure
a fair use of the books. They
only seem confining when they in-
terfere with individual whims. It
is unfortunate that there is not
more general rejoicing when the
book is there when it is wanted.
This I am glad to say is the rule
rather than the exception.

Doris H. Darnell

Col. M. J. Shelly’s Career Combines

Educational and M ilitary Occupations

Colonel Mary Jo Shelly was
sworn in as second Director of the
Women in the Air Force June 12,
1951. She was born in Grand
Rapids, Michigan, February 17,
1902, was graduated Phi Beta
Kappa from the University of
Oregon in 1926, and received a
Master’s degree from Columbia
University in 1929.

From 1930 to 1932, Colonel
Shelly served as graduate assist-
ant in education at Teachers Col-
lege of Columbia University
while doing preliminary work for
a Ph.D. degree. From 19382 to
1935, she supervised the teacher
training unit at New College, a
part of Columbia University. She
became assistant to the Dean of
Students at the University of
Chicago in 1935, and in 1988, went



to Bennington College as educa-
tional assistant to the president.

In September, 1942, she was
commissioned a lieutenant in the
WAVES, as one of the first 12.
WAVE lieutenants, and was pro-
moted to lieutenant commander
and commander. As Assistant for
the Women’s Reserve to the Di-

she directed the expansion of
WAVE schools from one officer

Sutton Evaluates
Five ‘Imperatives’

“The most subtle thing a teach-
er can give his pupil is ‘a genuine
reverence for life’,’ stated Dr.
Willis A. Sutton, addressing the
private school teachers of Mont-
gomery County, Wednesday, No-
vember 14, at their evening meet-
ing in Goodhart Auditorium.

Superintendent of schools in At-
lanta, Georgia and onetime preach-
er, Lir. Sutton asserted that the
movement of the world’s history

is forward. He attributed this to
the salutary -effects of education,
and enumerated the “Great Amer-
ican Imperatives” which he stated
must be taught to prevent the dy-
ing out of the human race.

These imperatives are: a regard
for human life, love for the soil, an
appreciation of a good home life,
a realization of the moral backing
of the universe, and finally, the
obligation of the teacher to instill
wonder into the minds of his pu-
pils.

Of the first American impera-
tive, applying to all of mankind as
well as Americans, Dr. Sutton said,
“A love of peace must be inculcat-
ed in our children or we will be
destroyed”. ‘We are hardened to
war; murders have become com-
mon and atrocities and accidents
are accepted without much dismay.
Amevicans have applied inventions
to means of death, and we do not
regard life or teach this to the
child. ‘The most valuable lesson’,
he concluded, “is the one, ‘Thou
shalt not kill’.”

Leve for the soil was the second
imperative stated by Dr. Sutton.
“The wealth of this country de-
pends on the earth”, he continued,
“and we must teach this to little
children who love the earth”. Dr.
Suttcn considered it more import-
ant to the wealth and character of
the country to love the soil than
to ba able to read. “No one who
really loves the soil is bad”, he
stated. He called the farmers the
“makers and builders of the world”
and pointed out that we only ma-
nipulate what they produce. “Land
is basic in life”, he said, “and we
must not neglect it”.

The review of Othello in | last
weel’s News was an excessively

‘long exercise in self-indulgence. If

a review has a “basis”, it also has
a constructive purpose. The basis
of this review was fidelity to the
“author’s meaning”, reiterated ten
times, not once justifiably, since
the reviewer is in no position to
expound Shakespeare’s intent.
The effect was destructive, dis-
torted, and the tone inexcusable.

Criticism Shows Lack
Of Appropriate /
Emphasis
To the Editor:

The last issue of the College
News included a review of the
Bryn Mawr-Haverford production
of “Othello” about which I would
like to say one or two things.

First, I found the review very
long indeed for something which
only slightly affected the college
as a whole, and which is, I sup-
pose, still simply entertainment,
not a reflection on the entire mod-
ern appreciation of Shakespeare
or a technical chef-d’oeuvre for

specialized technicians.

As a piece of entertainment,
Othello was quite adequate.

Second, I think that the director
ought to be congraulated for hav-
ing given us, in the very short
time permitted by college rules on
rehearsals, and with the acting
material at his disposal, a mature
and well-finished play. Several of
the newer actors were given
chances to develop parts, and may
prove to be the “stars” of future
college plays. And I think that it
should not be forgotten that Col-
lege Theatre tries to give theatri-
cal training and opportunities to
its members as well as worthwhile
Plays to its audiences.

Third, I believe that the failings
in “Othello” came, not from the
individual faults of the different
teams that made up the produc-
tion, but from a lack of unity of
design and purpose between them.
For example, the Elizabethan cos-
tumes in a Gordon Craig sort of
set, and the ingenious lighting
which seemed to play hide and
seek with the actors. To answer
technically to a very technical re-
view, I was disappointed by both
costumes and make-up, which
were hardly mentioned in the ar-
ticle. The costumes, perhaps with
the exception of Othello’s and the
Duke’s, did not add to the play
through the meaning of line and
color. All their  significance—
which is one of the Theatre’s most
effective tricks for helping ideas
across—was lost and I felt that
all the possible Elizabethan cos-
tumes had been pulled out of the
costume room and simply distrib-
uted according to size. The make-
up’s more subtle meanings may
have been lost in the intensity of
the lighting, but it was largely in-
effective and sometimes incongru-
ous, such as the violent rouging
and painting of Desdemona’s face,
especially in the first part.

I feel, in short, that the review’s
length, intensity of feeling, and
stress on techniques was dispre-
portionate and not quite fair to
the Bryn-Mawr-Haverford presen-
tation of Othello,

Student In Production
Applauds Thon
For Work

December 7, 1951

To the Editorial« Board of the
College News: °

As one who was close to the re-
cent production of Othello, may 1
offer my criticism of the lengthy
review which appeared last week.
On the whole, your reviewer’s
work seemed intelligent and
thoughtful. Many of her criticisms
were justified, and sne might have
made others had she veen so in-
clined. But that she tried to im-

pute every shortcoming to one per-
son only, at the same time taling
to give him credit most assuredly
nis due, appears to me a gross in-
justice. A dramatic production
does not often achieve its entire
success in spite of its director, and
a critic wno nas not been present
from first to last during its devel-
opment should exercise caution in
saying so. Having watched the

fairly closely, let me record an
opinion whicn 1 know to be sharea
py others as well; namely, that the
performances ot Uthello were as
successful as they were largely be-
eause of mr. ‘non’s direction and
in spite or the aistressingly large
number of obstacles he was called
upon to hurdle. 10 name a ew:

1) Dramawuec activity at haver-
ford in the Fall necessiiatea a lac-
er casting date than originauy
planned.

2) Goodhart presented produc-

tion provlems, with its size, its
poor acoustics, and a total lack vi
any properly-lighted apron.
8) Number of rehearsals wa.
limited, and an 11:30 curiew
clamped on most. Work couldn.
start before 7:30, so that, renears-
ing a three-hour show in four
hours each night, director and act-
ors alike were constantly conscious
of the limitations on their time.
The decision not to cut, I might
add, rested with all those most
concerned, and was made unani-
mously.

4) Last-minute lectures schedul-
ed in Goodhart cut grievously into
rehearsal time.

5) It was only through the ef-
forts of one or two of the Haver-
ford boys concerned that enough
players were found to fill minor
roles. ‘ihe amount of rehearsai
time spent fitting these extras into
the framework of the play was
more than your reviewer seems to
realize, and the detail of Mr.
Thon’s explanations to them was
truly amazing, as pressed for time
as he was.

I don’t pretend to have exhaust-
ed the list of difficulties encounter-
ed. You will, however, get some
idea of the circumstances from ali
this, and realize that Shakespeare
could never have been brought to
the Bryn Mawr stage without a
Mr. Thon to face the problems in-
volved. To my mind, he deserves
a vote of thanks for accomplishing
so much so quickly, and for mak-
ing possible the only production of
Shakespeare we have had here
during our college years.

You might say that, identified
with the production as I was, my
evaluation of it could not help be-
ing a favorably prejudiced one. I
believe this is true. But may I add
that, as thoroughly familiar, liter-
arily speaking, with Othello as
your reviewer so evidently was,
she could not have been expected
to see her first actual production of
it free from the vivid influence of
a personal, previously-developed
interpretation. Perhaps, then, she
is as unsuited as I to make the fin-

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Objections of Reader
Include “‘Stress”’
Of Critic
Dec. 8, 1951

The Graduate Center
To the Editor of the College News:

In view of the length of the re-
view of the Bryn Mawr-Haverford
production of Othello, altogether
disproportionate to the importance
of the performance in relation to
he college, I am sorry that cer-

ain’ unfortunate differences © in

pinion make furiher discussion
mperyative. That Othello was not

reaily a successful production I
igrec, but it seems to me that your
easons for this are not the ones
shat should be stressed.

You mention the play’s meaning
many times, and the understand-
ing of it that a reviewer and a di-
rector are able and expected to
have, but at no time do you state
Nhat you believe this meaning to

e. I also was among those who

ok Professor Sprague’s course,

nd am also a reader of the play,
vut I am yet to be certain in my
mind of what this meaning is. The
ack of any consistent interpreta-
tion or passion throughout the play
seems to me to be the greatest
reascn for its failure and to be t
fault of three things: first, the pe-
ulis:ly outmoded social system
n which the subject of the play
s set—thereby demanding excep-
ional brilliance in the actors to
make it interesting to a modern
audience, an underiaking further
somplicated by the length of the
play; second, the lack of both
stage experience and emotional
aatirity on the part of talented
. tors but no more than that; and
hist, the lack of harmony between
he .ctors, the make-up and cos-
umcs, the lighting, and the set.

For instance, Bianca’s movements
vere humorously modern, Desde-
nona’s_ stylized, Othello’s very
learly non-existent, Iago’s merely
ctive. The Twentieth Century
choo] of lighting and staging,
semi-Elizabethan costuming which
paid no attention to Elizabethan or
iny color psychology, added to the
:onfusion that destroyed any con-
sistency of interpretation. The
‘auit for this last lies upon every
yerscn connected with the play.

The choice of a play, the most
difficult of Shakespeare’s plays on
she counts of both subject and con-
struction, to be acted by amateurs
oth young and limited by short re-
earsals and outside requirements,

.eems to me a poc one, and I
jhink that the College Theatre
should consider these necessary

limitation as well as their financial
ones while choosing. I see no rea-
son to discourage the choice of
good plays summarily because of
their requirements; but that there
are many kinds of good plays,
good for many. reasons, should not
be forgotten. Othello is a difficult
play, having little action and a cu-
rious construction, and Shakes-
peare’s name does not make it
more or less difficult.

Those who saw the 1947 produc-
tion of King Lear may remember
that, although Lear himselt was
finely acted, it was not Lear, but
the villains, Edmund, Goneril, and
Regan, who dominated the play,
thus throwing it off balance. So
here, Flannery, despite the beauty
of his voice and his acting ability,
was unable to reach the stature of
a tragic hero and to dominate the
play, as the play demands. Unfor-

thereby to the campus.

But first I want it to be clearly
understood that I have not talked
to any member of the faculty or
started any steps towards its poss-
ible materialization.

A lot of courses are being given
each year in Bryn Mawr College
and few undergraduates in spite of
their good will are able to attend
or listen to all those that might in-
terest them, whereas some of them
might want to satisfy their intel-
lectual curiosity or correlate and
add to their special fields of study.

A suggestion was put forth,
whereby the News would publish
every two weeks or so a list of lec-
tures and their titles which might
be of interest to students. These
lists would come out bearing the
assent of the lecturing professors.
The work of coordinating and
planning the list would be the re-
sponsibility of the Curriculum
Committee. Though it might not
seem apparent at first glance, this
project will demand a lot of work
from the Curriculum Committee.
One, getting each professor’s as-
sent and title of the lecture or lec-
tures for the two week period.
Two, blocking a certain number of
available seats on the seating
charts. which are kept in the
Dean’s Office, specifying the exact
number of seats available for ev-
ery lecture.

But we must not forget that a
lot of extra curriculum lectures
are given on the campus through-
out the year whether by visiting
lecturers or members of our own
faculty and are open to all of us,
and intended to satisfy the need
outlined above.

I do not want to imply that the
Curriculum Committee is opposed
to any strenuous work which
might benefit the student body but
before embarking on such a vast
project we would like to know the

Meserve Devalues
Competitive Trend

The Reverend Harry Meserve,
of the First Unitarian Church, San
Francisco, California, spoke at a
tea given by the Chapel Commit-
tee on Monday afternoon, Febru-
ary 18, in his honor. The tea was
held in the Common Room.

Reverend Meserve amplified his
discussion of Sunday night, on the
subject of the shifting values of
our civilization. He said that the
emphasis in the world today is laid
almost entirely on competition.
Ever since Darwin published his
Origin of Species, men have ‘been
justifying their struggle to get
ahead in business by Darwin’s the-
ory of survival of the fittest. How-
ever, said ‘Rev. Meserve, “a grow-
ing body of evidence” has begun to
show that Darwin was not wholly
right. The stress should be put on

success in cooperation, not compe-
tition. The physical survival of
the race depends on cooperation;
most of the basic satisfactions of
life arise from situations shared
happily with others, from success
in cooperative situations.

Dr. Meserve said that the true

importance of religion lies in ways, | subject at hand, and features
means, and techniques for people |i iuded extras such as movies and

to learn the art of peace, coopera-
tion and understanding. A list of
these ways and means might in-
clude a comprehensive study . of
the sources of human aggressive-
ness. If man could discover what
‘produces aggression in individuals,
we might be able to remedy the
situation in regard to nations. An-
other investigation might cover
the field of meanings—that is,
what we mean by what we say.
People are so given to talking in
broad generalities, and ending by
“talking) in different directions,”
“The more we can talk in specific,
“pin-pointed instances,” said Rever-
end Meserve, “the more we agree.”

The third point on the list would
be the ways to draw everybody in-
to group life so that they really
feel a part of it. It is necessary
to work all kinds of people into
the group. Also important is the
technique of being able to see our-
selves as we work in groups, “to
see ourselves as others see us.”

There ‘is a great need for each
individual’s acceptance of his or
her own limitations in the activi-
ties of the group. The last point
which was mentioned was the tech-
nique of ‘listening.

These topics are the essence of
religious education. America is
proud of her way of life, and these
“ways and means” may make all
the difference between the success
and collapse of that way of life.
These skills will close the increas-
ing gap between the theory and
practice of the Christian way of
life, and “learning, study, and
quiet, patient efforts to develop
these skills may be the crucial
skill of the age.”

Current Events
Miss Leighton Reports

Current Events:

UNESCO

Monday night, February 18, Miss
Leighton discussed the third an-
nual conference for the U. S. com-
sission of UNESCO, which was
held from January 27 to 31 in New
York. e general purpose of the
conference was to contribute ‘to
peace through effecting a change
from a national viewpoint to an in-
ternational one. The specifit pur-
pose of the conference was to en-
courage participation in world af-
fairs by United States citizens
through the United Nations. To do
this, several sections were set up
in the conference.

The first consisted of sectional
meetings on major areas for world
peace, with discussion on educa-
tion, labor, communication and
on refugees. Twenty work group
sessions were held on social work,
teaching, U.N. and overseas work.

There were panel presentations
on Ideas for Resources for Under-
standing orld Affairs, and on
Pre-schoo} Affairs, for example.
The presentations were supple-
mented by movies, not always of
the most mature type, according to
Miss Leighton, but treating the

literature on all sorts of U.N. or-
gans, as well as United Nations ac-
tivities in Churches, Schools, and
Scout organizations.

Miss Leighton concluded by stat-
ing that the UN and the UNESCO
seem to have had success in in-
stalling techniques in internationai
understanding in pre-schools. It is
genuinely hoped that they will
have the same results in higher
education.

Mr. Berlin Interprets
Freedom and Authority

Continued from Page 1

It was in solving this problem
that Rousseau proved himself an
original thinker. The two compo-
nents of this thinking were a rigid,
logical reasoning and an intuitive
sense of right. His answer to the
problem of absolute freedom exist-

ing with absolute authority is that
maximum liberty and maximur.
authority are as two intersecting
lines. At the point of intersection
they are the same. Maximum lib-
erty and obedience coincide; there-
fore, because of this coincidence
there is no need to reconcile liberty
and obedience to authority. Man’s
desire for restraint is a Christian
philosophy.

(Men want to be happy. There
are certain rules which make them
happy. Once they are aware that
laws are beneficial, that they pro-
vide happiness, they will want the
laws. We must create the kind of
laws that men want to impose upon
themselves so that they will want
to obey those laws; they will de
sire authority.

Rousseau was conscious of man’s
relation to nature. He thought
that men should obserye what is
good in nature, its wholesomeness
and simplicity, and adjust them-
selves to the conditions of nature.
Peasants were closer to nature be-
cause of the simpilcity and sincer-
ity in their lives. The natural are
wise, and the wise, natural.

People should all want the same
qualities in an ideal state. If they
do not want the same thing, free-
dom must be forced upon them.
After they have tested it, they wi!)
want it. If men possess a ration-
al nature, they will know what is
right. If they do not know, they
must be educated to what is right;
they must be educated for free-
dom."

Our stay in Malta is fast draw-
ing towards a close. Yet there are
ever new things to see. Yesterday,
for instance, we were taken by
boat into “The Blue Grotto”, an
unbelievable place of great beauty,
almcst like a bit of Faerie Queene
landscape. And last week we were
guests at one of the great houses
of the island, where our host’s
portrait was marked “2ist Baron.
Still Going Strong”.

The sense of the nearness of the
past is remarkable. Only yester-
day, as it seems, the seventeen
Italian “E boats” tried gallantly
to break into the Grand Harbor,
and were shot to pieces by the
guns on Fort St. Elmo. But Fort
St. Elmo had figured, too, in the
Great Siege by the Turks in 1565.
And there, we were shown the lit-
tle chapel where the last of the
garrison, under the Knights of
Malta, died fighting. The. other
great fort, St. Angelo, held out
manfully. But this one is not to
be seen at present because of a
strike by the dock workers—a
rather serious strike. There is
much that is picturesque, also, in
the street scenes, with groups of
bearded sailors and bearded friars,
of monks and nuns—the whole
population turning out of an eve-
ning to walk slowly and talk rap-
idly in the streets.

As for plays—you were bound
to hear about them sooner or lat-
er—we have been pretty austere-
ly rationed. There were two
Christmas pantomimes by ama-
teurs from the Services (at least,
we got some idea of what this
strange survival was like), and a
professional Italian company in-
cluded Amleto in their repertory
here soon after Christmas. Ham-
let with five (5) intermissions of
almost operatic length and with
very little of the text left really
(even the first scene was omitted),
but with compensation in the act-
ing of Signior Annibale Ninchi as
the Dane. He was sixty-five,
rather clumsily built, and played
the part in a mousey blond wig.
But one forgot «all these things in
the beauty and intelligence of his
reading and in the brilliant use he
made of his hands.

Finally, we have had our own
Hamlet at the University, carried
out, with some help from me, by a
group of freshmen. We were ter-
ribly short-handed, and even with
a good deal of doubling had no one
left for Fortinbras—a fanfare of
trumpets (not from records eith-
er) helped out at the end. The
gravedigger prompted till it was
time for him to go on, when Pol-
onius took over. The Prologue to

the News for some time. By using

more than

urs realize that most students, de-
spite their casual attitudes, are
deeply concerned with the mean-
ing of education.

Beyond these ideas it is hard to
see exactly how much the writer
joes mean. Is she disturbed about
the methods of gaining knowledge?
Does she intend’ to question the
finality of marks? Because occa-
sionaily the focus of her thinking
seems blurred and the style of her
writing undisciplined, a topic
whieh deserves careful discussion
is only touched upon. It is unfor-
cunate that she has not further
clarified her thought and expres-
sion so that the same high level
would be maintained throughout.
For despite its structural faults,
this article, in what is generally
a casual column, represents an in-
teresting expression of student
thought.

Faculty’s Suggestions
Urged by Play
Committee

To the Editor:

The Bryn Mawr College Thea-
ter is now making plans for its
fall production. Since our plays
are of interest to the faculty as
well as the students, we feel the
faculty should have an opportun-
ity to indicate their—_preferences
and to express their opinions. We
would greatly appreciate any sug-
gestions concerning possible plays
for next fall. These can be sent



to Ann Blaisdell, Denbigh, through
campus mail, or written on the list
posted on the Theatre Arts bul-
letin board in Taylor. Any sug-
gestions will be seriously consider-
ed, and we hope the faculty will
use this opportunity to partici-
pate in campus life,

Lack of Contributions
Delays Arts Night
Until Fall

To the Editor:

The Arts Night Committee
(1951-52) announces with regret
that the performance of Arts
Night scheduled for May will be
postponed until the late fall of
1952. The Committee did not feel
that sufficient dramatic material
was submitted to insure a well-
rounded program, which would
match the calibre of previous per-
formances.

The Committee wishes to ex-
press its sincere gratitude to Mrs.
Paul, Miss McBride, Mr. Goodale,
the Freshman Octet, and all other
students who have given so much
time towards this production.

Most of the material submitted
will be used next year, and the
Committee hopes that many more
contributions will be forthcoming
in order to preserve the tradition
of Arts Night as an outlet for
creative talent on campus.

Sincerely yours,

Teen Club Tours

Pems at Carnival

A carnival in the rain can be
fun, too, the Silver Links Y Teen
Club decided when they were dis-
cussing whether or not they should
postpone their anticipated visit to
Bryn Mawr’s Sophomore Carnival.
The newly-created Y Teen Depart-
ment of the League had invited
the group to be its guests, and
was on hand to greet the 11 Negro
youngsters, students at Philadel-
phia’s Barrett Junior High School,
when they arrived on campus in
cars procured by the League.

In spite of the rain they were
laden with picnic lunches and lots
of enthusiasm, Some of the girls
were so excited about the trip that
they had gone to the city’s South-
west YWCA, where they were to
be called for, an hour earlier than
the appointed time.

League Lunches

Lunches, with milk provided by
the League, were eaten in the
rumpus room, after which some of
the girls played ping pong and
sang around the piano, while
others toured the library. They
enjoyed the parade from under
their umbrellas, and, for the most
part, thought that Denbigh’s float
was the best. (They, of course,
didn’t understand the significance
of prize-winning Rockefeller’s.)

Entertainment at the carnival
was paid for by the League, and
each girl took advantage of the
fortune-telling and refreshment
booths, especially. That they en-
joyed themselves and appreciated
the efforts of the League is
brought out in the following letter
which the League received a few
days ago:

1605 Catherine St.

Philly, Pa.
April 30, 1952.

Dear League members,

This is a letter to express our
thanks for having such a wonder-
ful time Saturday, April 26, 1952.

The girls enjoyed it so much
they are still talking about it.

Even though it rained and we
couldn’t be outside, you made it
seem as if we had all the room in
the world.

Thanking you again.

Sincerely yours,
Silver Links Y Teen Club.

thanks to all the students who
helped to make the celebration in

Liz Denegar, who dyed many of

No, I am not a Democrat for
Eisenhower. I am a Republican
for Ike, and I think my party has
made a fortunate choice in him,
because

1) He has had vast. experience
in foreign affairs, both in peace-
time and in. wartime. He knows
how to get along with people who
think differently than he does, and
has. never adopted a “let Papa
show you how this is done” at-
titude. Being a military man, he
knows what is practical for us to
do and what is not.

2) Since he is an Army man,
and used to years of no nonsense,
he can and will make decisions
after considering all sides of the
question and act firmly on his de-
cisions. Furthermore, he is a prac-
tical man and will not allow vacil-
lation, hangers-on, inflated pay-
rolls, corruption, graft, laziness
and the general downright thieve-
ry of the people’s substance, all of
which now characterize the ad-
ministration. No group can or
ought to expect special favors

Time to Change:
Roosevelt Views
Ike AS The Man

especially contributed
by Sara D. Roosevelt ’54

The Republican cry throughout
this campaign of 1952 has been
“it’s time for a change.” This
seems to many a too-oft repeated
empty phrase, so they ask “why”?
Why will a Republican adminis-
tration put us in any better a
position than we are now; and
after all, what is wrong with what
we have and what we have had for
the last twenty years? I would
like to try to answer these ques-
tions.

Foreign policy seems to be a
major issue at the present time,
We are in an extremely dangerous
international position, which is the
result of an unsteady policy, and
a lack of foresight. It is useless
at this point to spend time “blam-
ing” the Democratic administra-
tion for each of their mistakes
that have led us further and fur-
ther from international security,
but I would like to point out that
if the administration credits itself
with steps forward we have made,
it must also acknowledge respon-
sibility for the errors it made.

Entrance in Korea

For instance, our entrance in
Korea was a necessary move, but
the steps leading up to this move
were contradictory and indecisive.
The support of the Israel state
was policy of the Democratic
party, but at the same time the
Arab States’ good will was un-
necessarily lost. The Marshall
Plan is doing tremendous good to
hold Western Europe in the com-
munity of the Atlantic Pact, but
Eastern Europe has fallen  be-
hind the iron curtain.

The Democratic party has also
failed to take a definite stand
either on the Egyptian issues or
on the Persian issue. It seems to
me that one of the reasons a
change of party is so important at
this time is that the government
needs a shot of new blood in its
arm. Men would come into im-
portant positions who were not
hampered by a past record.

Whichever party wins the elec-
tion will find no pat solution to
the foreign situation, but with a
changed administration, there will
be no need to waste time apologiz-
ing for past mistakes. Men like
John Foster Dulles will be able to
test a policy of initiative on our
own which might be strong enough
to anticipate and stop the moves
of Russia.

Economy in Government

What about economy in the gov-
ernment? It appears that those
at present in control of our gov-
ernment feel the United States
has unlimited amounts of money
to spend. This country cannot af-
ford unplanned spending such as
has been going on in regards our
armed forces. :

It cannot afford the inflationary
results such heavy government
spending produces, and it cannot
afford a tax system which vir
tually wipes out the small busi-
ness man and the professional
man: backbones of our economy
and our culture. In so vital a
time America must be internally
strong economically to be able to
survive herself and to put her
money to the best use externally.
Much has been said during this
Continued on Page 6, Col. 4"
,,
cn1952-11-05.txt,['To the Editor of the College News:'],"

Information on all the jobs held
by students and on their total earn-
ings has seemed impossible to se-
cure. How many people would
make a record of each baby-sit,
each assignment of typing, etc?
The obvious guess is that very few
people would be bothered.

But this information has become
more important than ever before.

(1) Entering students trying to
plan for college and the higher
fees want to know how much they
can expect to make.

(2) Corporations considering gifts
for scholarships want to know how
much students earn.

iWe can’t answer unless we have
a complete and accurate survey.

Can we attempt the impossible
and find all the jobs students take
and all their earnings?

Mrs. Sullivan and the Vocational
Committee are preparing conven-
ient forms for the reporting of
this inconvenient information.

Please accept the inconvenience
of reporting all your jobs and
earnings! One year’s accurate sur-
vey will give us the basis for help-
ing both present and incoming stu-
dents.

T.V. Set Attracts
Relaxation Seekers

by Joan Havens, ’56

The box-like monstrosity which
has of late been seen decorating a
table in the rumpus room in Good-
hart Hall is not a missile from
Mars or a new-style bomb detec-
tor. It is Bryn Mawr’s new tele-
vision set. Since its installation
last week it has become a much-
used and enjoyable feature of the
room.

At almost any hour, students
who have prudently finished their
work, or otherwise, can be seen
sprawled in front of the set, or
frantically twisting those four
treacherous little knobs, attempt-
ing to get a program instead of a
bunch of wave lengths.

Actually it is a fairly simple
process for an _ intelligent Bryn
Mawr student to procure a good
program; the RCA Victor set is a
good one, with a large screen. The
exploits of Hopalong Cassidy and
college football teams show up
equally well.

Half of the cost. of the set, on
which we were given a discount,
was defrayed by the college. The
remainder was paid for by funds
of the Undergraduate Association.
To clear up wide-spread confusion
on this subject, it should be stated
that this money is not from the
Common Treasury. Dues will not
be increased due to the purchase of
the set.

Van Doren Views
Value of Student

especially contributed by
A. Blaisdell, 53 & L. Lawrence, ’53

Three essential qualities for a
teacher are: a desire to talk, a
need to explain, and a readiness to
listen. With these must be coupled
a mastery of subject, says Mark
Van Doren. Although the teacher
can gain this mastery from re-

search, he must also be willing to
learn from his students.

The most valuable student is the
one who says he does nét under-
stand; from him the teacher learns
where he has failed. For, the
teacher who thoroughly under-
stands his subject can explain it.
But, Van Doren adds, any amount
of knowledge is lost to the student
if the teacher underestimates his
students’ maturity and knowledge,
if he is condescending to “ignor-
ant” students, or if he considers
himself more important than his
subject matter. The teacher must
not stand between subject and
student lest the teacher’s person-
ality is remembered rather than
the material he teaches.

Mark Van Doren’s talk was one
of the highlights of the confer-
ence on college teaching held at
Haverford last week in which sen-
iors and teachers from fifteen col-
leges and universities participated.
Other problems discussed included
the place of research in the teach-
ing profession. As Louis Green of
Haverford asserted, research is
necessary but not sufficient. Teach-
ing and research should be mutual-
ly sustaining efforts. In addition,
Dean Harry Carman of Columbia
emphasized that tteaching should
never be considered a means of
financing research.

Pay Days Provoke
Expensive Delusion

by Joan Havens, ’56

That noble Bryn Mawr institu-
tion, Pay Day, is fast approaching.
What is Pay Day? It occurs six
times during the college year; one
can charge just about anything—
ranging from a toothbrush in the
hall bookshop to a tome on “The
Why and Wherefore of Organic
Chemistry” —to Pay Day. Pay
Day operates on the theory that
signing one’s life away, momen-
tarily speaking, for a date a month
or so in the future is superior to
dying in the meantime in slow in-
stallments.

Pay Day is ideal for three types
of students: procrastinators, those
who are lazy, and those who just
hate to pay for things. At Bryn

| Mawr dwell many belonging to a

distinct species—Pay Day Procras-
tinators. These deluded souls
would never think of paying cash
for so much as a book of matches;
they put off paying much as they
probably put off reading their
course assignments ’til tthe last
week of\the semester. Unfortun-
ately for them, it is impossible to
put off Pay Day itself.

Those students who employ Pay
Day due to laziness may be quickly
disposed of here. They charge to
Pay Day either because it is too
much trouble to carry a wallet, or
because it is easier to sign on a
Pay Day list than to count out all
that money or make out a check.

As for those who merely object
to paying for all things, Pay Day
for them is a sort of rationaliza-
tion. Théy' imagine that since
they’re not paying cash, they’re
not paying, period. But like both
the aforementioned groups, ’though
they manage to stave off the
guillotine, so to speak, for a time
— it does eventually fall, and fall
swiftly and painfully, in the form
of Pay Day."

Having investigated the situa-
tion by means of at least three
teas a week, we have come to the
conclusion that the College Inn is
lacking something in its catering
to the college. Admittedly we are
extremely fortunate in having a
place so near the campus where
we can get meals, and good ones
at that, but it seems to us that they
have been capitalizing on this
proximity and the lack of compe-
tition.

Not only is the service ungrac-
ious but it is often churlish, and
we feel that the management is as
equally to blame in its attitude as
it is for the rudeness of the
waitresses. To be specific, orders
are continually and unnecessarily
confused and extremely slow in
being brought (this may be the
fault of the kitchen). Requests are
snubbed or received with surli-
ness and patrons are often rushed
through meals because of kitchen
deadlines. Often the management
is unpleasant in making change or
checking to see that the slips are
signed. Although this is a neces-
sary precaution, it could be done
more cordially.

Furthermore, although the in-
clusive prices of meals are reason-
able, and meals are, as a rule, de-
licious and attractively served, the
prices of certain items are pro-
hibitively high. We mean speci-
fically orange juice and milkshakes.

These remarks are not meant in
a carping spirit, nor are they ap-
plicable to all of the staff and
management of the Inn. However,
we feel that the former high stan-
dard has fallen somewhat and we
offer this as helpful criticism.

the present speech requirement.
We must have some student opin-

go any farther. What we would

purpose of a speech requirement ?

2) Does the present freshman

3) If not, why not?

4) Should the course be required
or optional?

Expert Considers
UN Developments

The International Relations Club
convened in the Common Room,
Goodhart, on Tuesday evening,
December 9.

The first half of the program
was devoted to a film, “On Larger
Freedom”, presenting the work of
various agencies of the United Na-
tions in their attempts to combat
hunger, illiteracy and disease as
obstacles to world peace.

Mr. Robert. W.-.Sayer climaxed
the evening with an informal talk
about the problem that. the U.N.
was formed not to make peace but
to enforce a peace already well
established, and the split between
Communist and non-Communist
nations. Although the UN has
been unable to solve these two
problems, it has established a pre-
cedent by taking steps against
aggression, a precedent which may
avert future aggression.

Two other problems await UN
discussion and decision in the com-
ing months. In the Union of South
Africa, many Indians share with
African natives the injustices of

We would like to call to your
attention that the recent review cf
the Circle was merely a criticism
of the acting ability of the main
characters. In general one expects
more than that to appear in any
dramatic review. Some mention of
the director and an evaluation of
her work would be of interest es-
pecially since in this case she un-
dertook the job on such short
notice. Also in a small cast there
should be some mention of each
character — specifically comments
on the fine performance given by
Ann Donley. Finally we are ac-
customed, but not resigned to the
fact that the work of the Produc-
tion staff is ignored. The stage
manager, Coryce Ozanne, and her
assistant. Liz Gordon, certainly de-
serve recognition for their faithful
reproduction of a Georgian home.
This would not have been complete
without the period furniture ob-
tained by Lois Parry. It would
have been helpful, moreover, had
there been some explanation of
that part of the headline which
claimed that the play as a whole
failed. This review was not “utter-
ly, utterly, utterly detestable”, but
we feel it should have been more
inclusive.

Sanford Lectures
About Personality

especially contributed
by Anne Appell, ’53

On Thursday, December 5, Dr.
R. Nevitt Sanford, Director of the
Mary Conover Mellon Foundation
at Vassar College and Associate
Director of the Institute of. Per-.
sonality Assessment and Research,
Spoke on “Masculinity, Pemingty
and Authoritarianism.”

Dr. Sanford reported that in the
subjects studied by the Berkeley
Public Opinion Study, a correla- |
tion was found between high scores |
on ethnocentricism and denial of
feminine tendencies in the men and
of masculine tendencies ‘in the
women. Highly prejudiced men
tended to deny all femininity in
themselves and to overcompensate
by adopting ultramasculine pat-
terns of behavior, ;

In high scoring women, preju-
dice was the result of projecting
into minority groups the undesir-
able and inferior qualities which
they felt were attributed to them
as women. These women appear-
ed, typically, to be extremely sub-
missive but were actually repress-
ing desires to dominate, i. e., adopt
the masculine role. These two
‘types often attract each other but
are doomed to mutual disappoint-
ment when each discovers what
underlies the behavior of the oth-
er.

Dr. Sanford pointed out that in-
dividuals who scored high on eth-
nocentricism tended to regard the
opposite sex in essentially the
same manner as they did minority

;+| groups. The opposite sex was

yooked upon as a totally different,
i. e. inferior, species, to which it
was virtually impossible to relate.
High scorers tended to be manip-
ulative and somewhat fearful in
their attitudes towards the oppo-
site sex.

In a study conducted under Dr.
Sanford’s direction, a number of
male graduate students were test-
ed on Masculinity-femininity at
the verbal and performance level.
The result was that high scores in
masculinity at the verbal level,
combined with high scores in fem-
ininity at the performance level,
correlated with low rating on
originality, general personality
soundness and professional prom-
ise made by clinicians and the stu-
dents’ professors. On the other
hand, high scores in femininity at
the verbal level, combined with
high scores in masculinity at the
performance level, correlated with
high ratings on the above by the
clinicians and professors.

‘Dr. Sanford expressed the opin-
ion that the college girl should
recognize the existence of conflict-
ing masculine and feminine ten-
dencies in herself, and, ideally,
reconcile and combine them in the
way most conducive to personality
growth and a satisfactory adjust-
ment to life.

Ghiberti’s Art Reflects
Alberti’s Artistic Ideal
Continued from Page 1

ting.

The question raised then, is
whether this work of combined
ideals, which is so far superior to
and immensely more mature than
Ghiberti’s earlier door, (also done
for the Baptistery), was based on
the space conception advocated by
Brunelleschi or newly defined by
Alberti. Brunelleschi, basically an
architect, was what can now be
recognized as a precursor of the
more sustained ideas of Alberti
and Ghiberti. His architectural
approach failed when applied to
the scale of pictorial arts. But Al-
berti wrote for the painter and
sculptor, provided a _ perspective
theory based on vanishing and dis-
tance points and conceived of a
work of art as the whole made up
of its many parts.

There lies the basis of the riddle.
As Alberti conceived of art, so
Ghiberti produced it. The sequence
of chronological events, if recalled
at this point, proves that Ghiberti
had finished the ten panels two
years before Alberti put his treat-
ise in script form.

Nothing, though, prevents spec-
ulation upon the idea that artists,
stimulated by the intellectual free-
dom of the day, were airing their
views and that those of Ghiberti
reached the doors of the Baptist-
ery earlier than the similar ideas
of Alberti found expression upon
paper. Single figures in the sculp-
tural reliefs of Ghiberti do echo
the ideals of Brunelleschi. There-
fore Mr. Krautheimer suggests



Phip
Of Solid Philosophy

Charles Poore in his column
“Books of the Times” has describ-
ed the collection of the philoso-
phies of one hundred men and
women, made by Edward R. Mur-
row in his recent This I Believe.
This book, edited by Edward P.
Morgan and forwarded by Murrow,
gives many varied approaches to
what has been called a_ steady
philosophy. for a shaky time.

Among those quoted in the ar-
ticle were Jackie Robinson, Thomas
Mann, Elmer Davis, Herbert
Hoover, and Rebecca West. Anne
Phipps, a member of the class of
’54, now studying abroad, was also
quoted. She says, “This winter |
came to college. The questions
put to me changed. I was asked
eternal questions: What is Beau-
ty? What is Truth? What is
God? I wondered if I hadn’t been
worshipping around the _ edges.
Nature and art were the edges, an
inner faith was the center.”

Of Federation in Europe

each other. “Now that Hitler is
gone,” the Russian said, “we can
go back to normal. We hate each
other, so I don’t know why those
officials are talking about peace.”

At present, there is a stronge)
movement than ever before for
European unity. Previously, there
have been many plans, but until
the end of World War II, nothing
had crystallized . Then the Soviet
Union, by force, unified part cf
Europe in their own economic in-
terests. In some ways, this has
been beneficial. For example, Po-
land was flat on its back in 1945,
and the forced unification has
helped the Polish people to get
back on their feet. “Therefore,”
said Mr. Scott, “the forced unity
has created a position of kinetic
and potential political and military
strength.”

Many Europeans are now think-
ing in terms of unity. There are
two problems to be solved, how-
ever: 1) What place would Ger-
many hold in such a unity, and 2)
the question of Neutralism. Also
the Soviet Union is facing the
problem of disillusionment and
cynicism among the Russian
people. Up to a certain point, the
Soviet Union represented a pro-
gressive force, Communism based
on Marxism, but now the people

are becoming dissatisfied.

Mr. Scott does not think that
war is inevitable. He believes
that “historic osmosis is going on,’
that many concessions will be
made, and that there will be an
emergence of historic compromise.
With such compromise and the
ironing out of problems in the path
of European unity, there will be
no necessity for war.



that from Brunelleschi’s day for-
ward, the trend toward idealization
of the figure, space, and setting
had progressed relentlessly in ob-
jective art and subjective ideas. [t

tainly seem to have talked things

Current Events

Lattimore Delineates
Responsibilities
Of Writers

Mr. Richmond Lattimore gave the
second in a series of expansive
Current Events topics on science,
art, and philosophy with a lecture
on the place of literature in so-
ciety. Mr. Lattimore explained he
only intended to discuss the fiction
writer.

First he established that this
type of artist is not necessarily
poetical, colorful, or the type of
person who leads a picturesque
life. Very often these attributes
require the time and energy that
a writer, a busy man, does not
have to waste on them. To get re-
sults and tap the supply of fiction
material that is in everyone, he
needs to spend time in hard work,
he needs a talent for writing, and
he needs the gift for absorbing
concentration.

In his job of creating, the writ-
er will come upon certain laws and
compulsions that to some extent
take the control out of his hands,
and he cannot always rebel against
this kind of direction. Once the
| work is finished, however, the au-
thor can step outside of his former
role and survey his work dispas-
sionately, as a critic, and so
change it if part of it is damaging,
or not suitable to print.

In a society the writer has no
special rights, but as a citizen he
is responsible for the duties re-
quired of all citizens. As a writer,
it is his job to write as well as he
can, and if he is to do this he must
not make his political or humani-
tarian views his primary aim; as
a writer he is being a bad citizen
if he puts forward an attack on his
government as his main purpose.
Politics is no criterion for art, for
if a totalitarian artist has his con-
centration as his main purpose and
succeeds, then he is good. Mr. Lat-
timore does not like any kind of
censorship, but if a forceful writer
expounds in a destructive fashion
against his government, he should
conceivably be censored.

Hell Week Fun
And Spirit

Looking back on the last few
weeks. there seems to be some
question as to the relative merits
of Hell Week. As two students
who have seen both sides of Hell
Week, (one of us able to view it
also as an onlooker) we would like
to defend one of\ Bryn Mawr’s
most enjoyable traditions. There
has been much criticism of unit-
ing Hell Week with Freshman
Show. However this time of year
is the best for both the Fresh-
men and the Sophomores. The
Freshmen have begun to feel real-
ly at home and by this time know
most of the upperclassmen as weil
as those in their own class. Us-
ually done in the spirit of fun, Hell
Week does bring the Freshmen
and Sophomores closer together.
You will also find that the Soph-
omores take into account the
amount of time each Freshman is
putting into Freshman Show and
act accordingly.

We do think that a greater at-
tempt should be made to keep Hell
Week out of the classroom. But
as for Hell Week destroying the
sophisticated and intellectual myth
of Bryn Mawr we say Hooray.
The majority of the college en-
joys a good time as much as any-



Entered as second class matter at the Ardmore, Pa., Post Office
Under the Act of March 3, 1879

Michi Kawai

The death of Michi Kawai on February 10 brings a loss
not only to Japan and the United States, but to Bryn Mawr
as well. For this internationally-admired pioneer Christian
educator was the second Japanese scholarship student at
Bryn Mawr, and a graduate of the Class of 1904.

Michi Kawai, the daughter of a Shinto priest converted
to Christianity, was born on July 29, 1877. She commenced
her formal education at the mission school of Sapparo, then
entered a school for advanced English in Tokyo. An excel-

lent student, she received a scholarship to Bryn Mawr; after
graduating with highest honors, she obtained a year’s fellow-
ship to Kurope. Michi Kawai returned to Japan where she
founded a Presbyterian girls’ school—the “Fountain of Bless-
ings, Girls Learning Garden”— at Keisen in 1929. During
the 1930s she promoted the United Church of Christ in Jap-
an, and during the Second World War the Japanese Govern-
ment permitted her to open the Keisen Horticultural College
tor Women.

President of the Keisen school since 1929, founder of the
Horticultural College and of the Japanese Christian Univer-
sity at Mitaka, one of the only two women on the Educational
Committee of five hundred members—the other is Ai Hos-
hino, a Bryn Mawr graduate of 1912 and President of Tsuda
University—a delegate to the Boards of Foreign Missions
in the United States and Canada, an author, lecturer, coun-
sellor to many, a student of Western educational methods as
well as a supplicant for Western financial support of her
schools—Michi Kawai’s life was full and rewarding, not only
to herself but to the many who benefited from her tireless ef-
forts, and who will continue to benefit from them in the fu-
ture.
In Japan it is the custom for a lantern-bearer, carrying
a paper “chochin”, to light one’s way at night. In her book,
MY LANTERN, Michi Kawai envisions the Christian lead-
er’s work: “I, too, am a chochin bearer, going ahead to light
the dark paths for the children of my Master until we come
out to the highway where my service is no longer needed, and
I am free for another task.” »

“Away, away, not a moment io linger”—these words
from the first hymn that she learned in English symbolize
the life of Michi Kawai, an honored Bryn Mawr alumna, a
_ great woman, and a sincere Christian."

Can anything be done about the
tea-shoppy attitude that has af-
flicted: the style. of some of the
News’ editorials, poems, etc., re-
eently? Why do we have to have
‘a poem ending “ .. . It’s really,
truly spring!”? Is it necessary
to refer to May Day as “the an-
nual May Day festivities”, and
then five lines later to talk about
the “unruly morning visitors”
“disrupt the. festivities” ?

In another editorial we read

that “... (traditions) are enjoyed,

obvious statements saturated with
pseudo-sentiment seem out of

Max Lerner Emphasizes

Continued from Page 1
religious and racial restriction still
must be broken down, “the work
to be finished in creating an open
society.” Nevertheless, we live in
an essentially open society, whose
core is the freedom of intellectual
belief.

In research for a ‘inal on Amer-
ican civilization, Mr. Lerner noted
changes in the American person-
ality which, coupled with existing
political conditions, present a
threat to an open society. The
American people are following a
trend toward conformity; life
goals are based on success, pres-
tige, acceptance. It has become in-
creasingly important for the in-
dividual to feel that he is liked
and accepted, and he is willing to
conform to certain standards to
achieve that sense of security in
society.

The Cold War has had its in-
fluence, in the form of an intense
fear:of Communism, which has put
more and more emphasis.on con-
formity. . ;

It is only within a structure such
as this that McCarthy has any im-



Value Of Open Society, |:

| Stressing Courage, Freedom and an Open Mind

portance. We are faced with the
problem of a small group which
has the power to sit in judgment
upon the rest of the country, and
many people are frightened. This
group of “grand inquisitors” has
the power of subpoena, the power
to punish contempt, and the power
of publicity, by which they can ef-
fectively destroy the position of an
individual in society. “They are
the ‘killers of the dream’, who
wrap the flag around the naked
shoulders of their reaction.”

We must as a people recapture
the tradition of a people who did
not fear to emigrate to a new
country, to defy the wilderness of
an unknown land to build a new
civilization. We are now in danger
of destroying ourselves as did the
Emperor Jones, who, caught in a
jungle of his own fears, died of
his own bullet.

“I am a man of perfect faith,”
concluded Mr. Lerner. “I believe
it best in the words of John Milton
to ‘Let truth and falsehood grap-
ple; who ever knew truth put to
worse in a free and open encoun-



ter.’”



Current Events

Mrs. Manning Lectures
On Leadership
' Of G. O. P.

This week Current Events offer-
ed a lecture on the Eisenhower Ad-
ministration by Mrs. Manning. In
introducing her topic she comment-
ed on the personnel of the cabinet
—“‘as some wag remarked, ‘ten
millionaires and a plumber’.”” She
stressed that Eisenhower’s choice
of these men is “not important be-
cause they are rich, but because:
they represent top leadership in
big business in this country today.”

She went on to say, “Americans
should accept the fact that it is
large scale production that has
been responsible for winning two
wars and that all efforts to get rid
of ‘bigness’ have not only failed
but must also appear to any rea-
sonable person to be perfectly fu-
tile. If we are facing the possibil-
ity of a third world war we are not
likely to win by any other means.” °

Big Business

Mrs. Manning added that big
business has also made consider-—
able progress in improving the re-.
lations between workers and. em-
ployers.

At the present time, she feels, |
the most real conflict within the
GOP is probably between large and
small business. “The small busi-
nessman has always been in favor
of a protective tariff, or a return
to as much isolationism as appears
to be possible, or reducing taxes,
etc. And because there are so many.
more small businessmen than
there are great industrialists and
financiers, they had considerably
more influence in party conven-
tions and party councils before
elections than any other group.
This predominance came to an end
at the Philadelphia Convention in
1940.”

Small Business

Eisenhower is now faced with a
Congress where the influence of
the small businessman is very
strong. He and his party also face
a serious difficulty in that ‘most
businessmen “have not ever really
faced the problems of government
which often touch a great variety
of values which can’t be reckoned
in terms of profit and loss.”

Finally there is the problem of
businessmen making themselves
over into politicians. Mrs. Man-
ning said that “it would be a great
help (to President Eisenhower) if
at least one member of the cabinet
knew how to speak the language
of the politicians and perhaps even

more important the language ‘of
the press.”

In spite of these difficulties, she
concluded, “there is a good deal
of evidence to date that the Repub-
licans in Congress are accepting
Eisenhower leadership and realize
that, to paraphrase Ben Franklin,
the Republican party must hang
together if Republicans are not to
face defeat separately.”

This’ letter is’ my reaction to
“Stones from a Glass House” in the
News of February 10th. I should
like to begin by saying that I am
in no way “defending” the faculty;
part of the excellence of Miss
De Baryshe’s column lay in its com-
plete lack of censure, so’ that any
“defense” would be out of keeping.

There are, I think, certain spe-
cific things that the student can do
to achieve the relationship Miss De
Baryshe describes as lacking. 1
believe that the ifftiative must
come from the students, because
the faculty is in rather a difficult
position. An invitation from a
professor is one that no student
cares to decline, knowing this, a
professor may hesitate to put a
student on the spot. If a profes-
sor expresses a wish to join a
group of students at tea, the stu-
dents may feel it is a “command
performance” — again, a professor
has no wish to put a student on the
spot.

It used to be customary to in-
vite professors to dinner in the
halls. There are all sorts of ad-
vantages to this, the most obvious
one being that if you invite one or
two professors, you can surround
them with at least six. students,
thus dividing the clamminess of
the palms by six. Furthermore, if
it is a senior who has issued the
invitation, she can includé juniors
and underclassmen in the party
and take it out of the realm of
“just another senior privilege’.
There is a superstition that you
must surround a faculty member.
with students who are in his de-
partment; this is absurd. Pre-
sumably those students already
know their professor — the object

is to bring in those who don’t.

In conclusion, may I say that I
consider “Stones from a Glass
House” the most constructive step
the News has taken recently."

oneself a man is more fundamental
than to think”, said Unamuno. Mr.
Alcala, in his Current Events Lee-
ture, stressed this aspect of the
Spaniard’s character in dealing
with the/political, economic and
cultural patterns of “Spain in the
World Today”.

Although Spain is a dlatatocéhte,
it is unique. The Spanish. people
have'a feeling for democracy since
they have such. great regard for
the dignity of man. Yet they are
not ready for a democratic regime
‘because “each Spaniard considers
himself a king” and it is difficult
to arouse a feeling of responsibil-
ity for the community.’

Censorship is somewhat. peculiar.

'It governs books, films, and news-

papers, but does so neither logical-
ly nor consistently. At the same

American Aid

The dictatorship has also revived
the Imperial feeling. Spain at-
tempts cultural organizations to

stresses the kinship hetween Spain

all foreigners are closely surveyed.

Franco’s position is strength-

and the pact. between the two na-
tions, since he assumes that the
United: States backs his domestic
and international policies. This
same pact is a source of disap-
pointment to Spanish Republicans
who are surprised at the “land of
liberty”. Falangists, the party
which put Franco into power, feel
that America has at last seen that
their way is “the right one’’.



Economically Poor

Economically, Spain is a very
poor country. Wages are low, but
somehow, almost everyone is cheer-
ful and makes ends meet. People
go to bullfights and the movies,
and seem to dress rather well.

There is a shortage of electric
power resultant from the poor
rainfall of the past years. \ Often,
during the summer, there ay be
as many as five days per week in
which there is no electric current.

A group of small ducks, some
flying, some waddling, some even
four-legged, quacked noisily. A few
minutes later rubber balls and pup-

Library Council —
~ Fetes Assistants

A meeting of the Library Coun-
cil and. student librarians was held
in the west wing on Wednesday,
February 24. The purpose of the

ee meeting was. to try to establish a

better relationship between stu-
dents: and the Library.

Phyllis Tilson, chairman of the
Library Council, pointed out that
the: questionnaires distributed to
the students about a month ago
concerning library rules and re-
_sponsibilities revealed that the stu-
dents are not familiar with the li-

brary rules, especially those of the;

Reserve Room. Students are en-

‘couraged to ask questions of the’

assistants when they are unsure
about anything, no matter how
minor it may seem.

Two changes of policy have been
established in the Reserve Room
recently. The first regards taking
books out overnight for someone
else; the rule now states that the
student should sign her own name
and the name of the girl for whom
she is taking the book.

The second change has been
made within the past week. There
will be limited reserve room fines
against non-resident students since
they are unable to go home for a
late book.. The Council hopes this
rule will not be abused. -

These two changes were made
as a result of student and librarian
suggestions. Another suggestion
is being considered which would
involve ‘sending over-due notices
for regular books once a month.
Students are encouraged to make

suggéstions to the Library. Council |

gestions. in the Suggestion Box in"

This concerns a touchy subject— |:

one very close to the daily life of
most Bryn Mawrters — knitting.
Some professors do object to knit-
ting in their classes and they have
the opportunity to object. But lec-
turers are rarely asked their opin-
ions on knitting and therefore at
every lecture, out comes the ar-
gyle patterns, sweaters, scarves

I have talked to a few of the lec-
turers who have been invited to
the college and they have said that
the stimulated look upon our faces’
during their lectures is usually not
due to the content of the talk, but
due to the fact that you found that
stitch you dropped.
You-want to knit ?—Fine—do it
elsewhere, but please don’t clack
your knitting needles in a lectur-
er’s face. The Common Room at
Goodhart may stress an atmos-
phere of informality, but that is
no reason for rudeness. Try con-
centrating on the lecturer and not
-on whether you'll have Tom’s socks

Current Events

' IndividualConsideration | Ms: Woolston Explains

Depressions And
Forecasts -

An economist advertising the
mistakes of her profession was the
unusual phenomenon whic
place in current events’ last Mon-
day evening. The economist, Mrs.
Woolston, did not @o°this just *to
“wash dirty linens in public.” We
can--profit, and she hoped that we
all would profit, from these mis-
takes in the past by attempting to
avoid them in the future, and, by
avoiding the omewhat lessen
the effects of depressions.

A review of depressions and
slumps seems to tell a tale of blun-

ders on the part of the economist.
In 1925, after World War I, Brit-
ain felt that if she did not deyalue

the world on the gold standard, a
depression was bound to occur.

Today,..off the gold standard,
‘our economy seems remarkably
healthy.

. In 1927 economists predicted the
fall of the Russian economy and
complete failure in all endeavors
when the U.S.S.R. adopted her first

.|five year plan. Disaster never

seamed to.strike, In 1928 and 1929,
however, all changes on the stock
market were thought to be slight
Yreadjustments of our very healthy
economy.

mists were in the camp. of those
who belittled the future of Adolph
Hitler. They felt he was sure: to
collapse because of the inflation in
Germany and the persistence of his
government in spending money.

After the war, few felt that the
United States could weather the
crisis of reconversion to peace-time
economy. Unemployment figures
were predicted-at as much as 12
million. Actually no more than 8
million were unemployed during
this period of adjustment following
the sécond world war.

Plight of Forecaster

“Forecasting,” therefore, accord-
ing to Mrs. Woolston, “is a thing
we may be able to do some day
with the help of the psychologist,
the political scientist, and the soci-
ologists as well as the economists.”

Of .course the forecaster is al-
ways in a funny position. If his ad-
vice ig heeded then the things he
forecasts never occur ‘and he: is
viewed with skepticism. If he is
not heeded, then, when the disas-
ters occur, he is eyed with the dis-
like that the ancients gave to Cas-
sandra,

Due to all these failures the
economists have adopted ‘a method
which they. call projection. It is not
a forecast, but an assumption.

Mrs. Woolston then discussed the
relations of what she had discussed
to the economic situation directly
ahead of us. Lately, there has been
a rise in unemployment and.. low-
ering of the. amounts of retail
sales, —

What happens in the future de-
pends on the operations of two
things in our present economy

tion. One is the built-in stabilizers,
things like the present income tax
rate, unemployment compensation,
and social security, which will help
in time of slump.

The second is the potentialities
of our resources. The success of
these depends on our resources,
ability, organization and foresight.

Through these, we and the gov-
ernment, can go on to assess our

In. view of the fact that absences
at hall and class meetings are
sometimes unavoidable, we think
that the fines levied are out of all

proportion to the offense. Although

the Hall Representatives are often
lenient in. overlooking a yalid ex-
cuse, it is our opinion that the-im-
position of fines should not be left
to their discretion. No lessons are
learned by paying an arbitrary
sum, and now that there is so much
talk on campus in regard to a
more: complete honor system, per-

‘haps it could be extended to in-

It would seem that the peren-
“meeting-cutter” would be
less apt to abuse this system as
evidenced by the good attendance

These figures ‘make us wonder if
perhaps we haven’t an obligation
to Bryn Mawr from the moment
we enter the college. Part of the
obligation is to know the state of
the budget, if only vaguely —so
that we’ll be well informed about
this aspect of our education also.

“MBy Evvie DeBaryshe, ’56

I sat in the Reading Room as a
Freshman, with the first final
exam of my life approaching on
leaden feet; I could hear it stomp-
ing down the aisle, echoing like
doom. It was a,time calculated to

give rise to thoughts the sys-

which has haunted’ me ever since.
It is not original, but it is my
own,:.and each one of my nine
o’clocks makes me long more poig-
nantly for its impossible realiza-

My vision is one of a college en-
dowed with bulging library, over-
powering hordes of professors and
a total lack of scheduled classes.
The library would be equipped with
luxurious smokers of a beauty and

ties of a soyt in which the mind
plays too small a part to be ad-
versely affected by unpleasant sur-
roundings. No conference might
begin until ten-thirty in the morn-
ing, and later on rainy days.

In order to insure that the -stu-
dents would not suffer from lack
of occupation, reading or lab as-
signments would be doubled and
papers, or experimental research,
would be assigned in far greater

The conferences would serve a

Taxi Prices Vary,

Because of reports of unreliabil-

company at the Pennsylvania Sta-

been made of the policiés of both
companies. :

Reports of variance in price
from the college was explained by
the Bryn Mawr company (BR 5-
0513) by the fact that the charge
is made both for distance and time,
arid the time spent in traffic lights
may alter the charge.

In general, this company charges
thirty-five cents from Pembroke or

and twenty-five cents from Rocke-

Gym’s Sun Lamps

Been down to the gym lately?

| If so, you’ve probably noticed a

pink non-athletes coming from the
direction of the A. A. room, say-
ings like “and you get a
whole 35 minutes worth for only
a quarter!”, and “yes, it only takes

seem a little odd. Not to mention
their coloring—red faces on a
rainy day—this can’t be sunburn!
But it is—it must’ be—it looks so
much like it,

it is. ‘tnere are two new sun-
lamps down at the gym, in the
mysterious A. A. room. By drop-
ping a quarter ‘nto the slot on
each lamp, five minutes (equival-

The sun worshippers in
front of the lamp for five minutes,
with eyes protected with sun-

Perhaps the best thing about
these sun-lamps is that they allow
everyone to get a tan—without
overdoing it. Few people will
spend two quarters in a row—even
for a tan, so few people get really
bad burns—the danger of “real”
sun. Waiting a day in between,
everyone gets more adjusted to
both the idea of spending another

Bryn Mawrters Supervise Activities

Of Some Philadelphia Y-Teen Groups

Several afternoons a week, girls
from Bryn Mawr take the P. & W.
to Philadelphia to spend a few
hours with Y-Teen groups there.
There are several groups of girls,
and the prospective leader chooses
from among these which she shall
guide.

For example, among activities
carried on are those of 6th graders
who meet after school for an hour.
The meeting starts off, im the best
democratic tradition, with a busi-
ness meeting, at which the busi-
ness of the day is disposed of, and
the all-important dues collected.

‘Then the group proceeds to do
what was planned at the last meet-
ing. This may be anything from
making scrapbooks for hospitals
to planning parties. - This year,
there was a highly successful Hal-
lowe’en party, to which each guest
brought a contribution.

To learn more about industry,
the group took a trip. to an ice-
cream factory, where the manufac-
tiring process vied for their atten-
tion with the free samples thought-
fully provided. The girls, who
are of high school age, decided that
they wanted to get to know Phil-
adelphia, and spent some time vis-
itimg museums and other points of

_linteresf in the city.

* The Y-teens do not consist of
underprivileged children, .although
the girls are of all racial back-
‘grounds. They merely run on the
theory that the more people do a
thing, the more fun it is. Since
this is the purpose of the Y-Teen
groups, the leader néeds only ‘help
the girls carry out the plans which
they themselves decide on.

Working with the Y-Teens means
helping young girls to express
themselves socially and creatively
by making possible projects which
require guidance. Besides, it is a
good opportunity to share in a lot

Schrecker Connects
Kant,’89Revolution

Mr. Paul Schrecker, renowned
historian of philosophy, traced
Kant’s justification of the French

Revolution in his lecture, Kant and

the French Revolition, delivered
Monday evening.

Mr. Schrecker observea that
without suspecting it and without
understanding it, the French acted
in agreement with Kant’s concep-
tion that mankind moves by de-
grees toward the highest good—
perpetual peace. In terms of such
progress, the French republic may
be said to have sprung from pure
sources of justice.

When the revolution occurred on
the other side of the Rhine, Kant
hailed it as a step toward eternal
peace. Even the reign of terror
failed to alter his judgment.

Attacking the adversaries of the
French Revolution as “shunning
the light”, Kant believed that lib-
erty and equality were man’s nat-
ural, innate, inalienable rights.
Fraternity, the third principle of
the revolution, was for Kant an
obligation rather than a right.

In practice, Kant wanted nations
to adopt a government in which
there was a republican constitution
This
was the policy of both the Constit-
uent Assembly and the National
Assembly.

Even if the revolution is taken’

out of its emotional context and
viewed according to actual events,
its justification cannot be denied.

For example, when Louis XVI
delegated power to the Constituent
Assembly, he put sovereignty in
the hands of the people. This less-
ens any illegality attributed to the
revoluatién.

Although the event consisted of
the deeds and misdeeds of men,
what mattered was the sympathy
evoked
“Sympathy”, noted Mr. Schrecker,
‘is the moral disposition of man-
kind and can never be grafted on
egoism. Thus, the progress achiey-
ed in this revolution of an intelli-
gent nation pertained not just to
that nation but to all mankind”.

Current Events

Critical Conditions Beset
Pakistan Today, —
Says Wells

“Even under the most stable
conditions it-is-not easy to-launch
a new state.” And the people in
Pakistan are working under some
of the most difficult. circumstances,
explained Dr. Wells at Current
Events Monday night when he
talked on “The Crisis in Pakistan.”

A New York Times editorial
says, “These are the growing pains
of a democracy,” while Time mag-
azine takes the presumptuous view
that, “Bloodlessly Pakistan has
changed from a stable pro-Western
democracy to a more stable pro-
Western dictatorship.”

Actually the question boils down
to whether, a common religion is
strong enough to unite two coun-
cries separated by one thousand
miles of hostile territory and hav-
ing diverse economic positions. An-
other major problem is that al-
though there are forty-two million
people in East Pakistan as-com-
pared with thirty-four million in
West Pakistan, the central govern-
ment is in the western sector and
largely controlled by it.

, People Discontented

There has been much economic
discontent and envy of one section
by the other. In East Bengal
where most of the raw jute,.so im-
portant to the country, is grown,
the standard of living is extraordi-
narily low. The people feel that
they have gotten the short end of

‘developmental projects and that

they are not getting their share of
imports.

This economic strife can be
translated into political terms.
When-the first election in many
years was held in East Pakistan,
last March, the old Moslem League
was defeated disgracefully. The
so-called “popular front” party,
partially controlled by communists
and promising anything the people
wished to hear, won two-thirds of
the legislature.

The new government leader be-
gan talking about “removal of the
official barriers” between East Ben-
gal and West Bengal, the part
owned by India.. He was immedi-
ately called a traitor. Riots broke
out.

Executive Rule

The governor general of Pakis-
tan, Ghulam Mohammed, who is a
representative of. the British
crown, sent'troops to East Pakis-
tan, deposed the cabinet, and put
aside the legislature because*“they
had lost the confidence of the peo-
ple.” East Pakistan was put un-
der executive rule.

‘When this happened Prime Min-
ister Mohammed Ali cut short a
trip in the western world and hur-
ried back to his homeland. Since
then there has been a continual
dismissing of governments on the
provincial level for maladministra-
tion.

West Pakistan, the more indiis-
trialized sector, has strong mili-
tary forces which support the gov-
ernment. But this government,
which was elected indirectly in the
first place, has been in power for a
long time.

_ All
States’ policy toward Pakistan,
Are we wise. in getting involved in
military aid to this country which
might easily turn out to be a mili-
tary dictatorship ?

“Students in every country have
a unique responsibility,” explained
Mr. Agarwala. “The way that they

He pointed out that the way 1n-

it is ditncult, however, for students

' Practical Aid Lacking

For example, 90 per cent of the
students are trained in the humani-

medicine and engineering are dras-
tically limited. It is therefore
practically impossible tor students

Living conditions affect the atti-
tudes of the students towards so-

streets, they can afford to buy only
a few books, and they are hungry
much of the time. Anyone with an

A Challenge

Mr. Agarwala said that the In-

that democracy is challenged to

Panel Discusses Collegiate Preparation

As Part Of Alumnae Weekend Program

“Whence and Why,” or the prob-
lem of college preparation and se-
lection, was the topic for a panel
discussion by secondary school
heads and Bryn Mawr faculty
members. The discussion, held in
the Music Room on November 18,
was a part of the Alurnnae Week-
end program. —

Miss Isabel Gamble, , Assistant
Professor of English, and Mr. Hen-
ry Seattergood, Head Master of
Germantown Friends School, em-
phasized the problem of college
preparation,

Miss Gamble felt that in prepa-
ration for the freshman English
course, schools should stress skills
rather than facts. As the basic
skill of the “ideally prepared fresh-
man” she listed the ability to read
well —- “rapidly, attentively, and
precisely.”

Thinking Hardest

Miss Gamble also felt that.to de-
velop the habit of clear and logical
thinking, schools should emphasize
critical rather than creative writ-

“ing; -She-illustrated this need by
telling of the college freshman who

explained that she found no diffi-
culty in reading or writing but

“ that it was “this thinking” that

got her. down.

Mr. Scattergood discussed the’i in-
dividual academic work and guid-

ance that: is offered at his co-ed
day school, stressing what he con-
sidered two important factors in
college preparation, The first of
these was the tendency of second-
ary schools to anticipate college
work, and to concentrate on offer.

. ing it to the student instead of the

work that is best for his stage of
development.
Mr. Seattergood also felt that



secondary school counseling should
be organized so as to give the stu-
dent the greatest chance to make
his own decisions.

Miss Barbara Colbron, Head Mis-
tress of the Spence School for
Girls, and Mrs. Rex W. Crawford,
Principal of Philadelphia High
School for Girls, discussed the
problems of college selection from
the viewpoint of private and public
schgol students.

Closeness to Haverford?

Miss Colbron, who graduated
from Bryn Mawr in 1937, felt that
intellectual curiosity was only one
of the reasons why girls from pri-
vate schools go to college. The
others were a desire for prestige,
greater independence, friends of a
wider background, freer social life,
and a career, They choose Bryn
Mawr in particular because of the
high character of its work, as well
as its size; location, and closeness
to Haverford.

Mrs. Crawford felt that on the
whole, the public high school has a
more difficult task in interesting

students in college because of their

diversity of background, the pres-
sure to take a commercial rather
than an academic course, and the
competition of athletic and social
activities.

Why College?

Dr. Davidon, Assistant Professor
of Psychology, pointed out that the
problem was not so much “Which
college to go to” as “Why. go to
college.” He felt that too many
students go to college berause “it’s
the right thing to do.” The result
is that some students in college
would be better off elsewhere, and
tentially good students in
high school never get to college.

Two College Drama
Club Gives Oedipus

Sophocles’ Oedipus at Cotonnus,
W. -B. Yeats’ translation, opens
with Oedipus as an old man,
weary and bitter, wandering
through Greece in his exile. He is
seeking a final resting place for
himself, where he may finally find
peace.

This resting place is extremely
important for an ‘oracle has de-
creed that the city near which
Oedipus is buried will become the
greatest city in Greece. The loca-
tion of his grave acts as a centri-
fugal force drawing the characters
into focus. The ever-present Greek
chorus sets the mood and acts as
narrator in several instances. The
conflict between the characters
forms: the theme of the play.

Oedipus at Colonnus was publish-
ed in 1934 and was produced at the
Abbey Theatre in Dublin.

Pauling Discusses
HisProtein Theory

“All of this structure work will
lead to an increase in our under-
standing. of living organisms,”
said Dr. Linus Pauling, American
scientist scheduled to receive the
1954 Nobel chemistry award. Dr.
Pauling is best known to Bry
Mawr students as the author
their first year laboratory manual
and chemistry text book.

The 53-year-old professor of
chemistry. at the California’ Insti-
tute of Technology: spoke before a
capacit wd at the Franklin In-
stitute on Tuesday, November 9, on
“The Structure of Proteins.” A
world-renowned expert on this sub-
ject, he will receive the Nobel prize
for his work in studying the na-
ture of chemical] bonds.

It has been said that if in the
next fifteen to twenty years we are
going to come to an understanding
of the difference between: dead
matter and living material, it will

be through the discoveries made|



by Dr. Pauling. He himself firmly
believes that. an essentially com-
plete protein structure pattern
could be made within the next dec-
ade.

Amino Acids

His work has probably done
much to simplify the interpreta-'
tion of X-ray photographs, an im-
portant tool in determining struc-
ture. Instead of studying proteins
directly, Dr. Pauling’ decided to
test amino acids and _ peptides
which are closely related to pro-
teins.

He came upon the helical struc-
ture of polypeptide chains as evi-
denced by the fact that they
stretch. Hair is an example of the
type containing these so-called al-
pha helixes. Thé spirals have 3.6
residues per turn and bend at an-
gles seven Angstrom units from the
axis. The enormous protein mole-
cules are made up of these twisted
atom chains spiraling many layers
deep.

Reviewers Note Flaws in ‘Crucible’ Cast

But Consider Presentation Worth Seeing

By Molly Epstein, °56
and Marcia Case, ’57

Arthur Miller’s The Crucible is
a play which portrays mass hys-
teria and the development of a
man’s ethic against the historical
setting of the Salem witch trials.

Basically, the play is a fine and
moving one, deriving its great
power from the situation rather
than from the undistinguished dia-
logue. The subject matter inevit-
ably evokes comparisons with the
contemporary American scene, ‘but
it is a parallelism of mood rather
than of incident. Salem is Salem,
and not a thinly veiled Un-Ameri-
can Affairs Committee.

The plot concerns a group of
young girls led by one of their
number™ (whose essential motiva-
tion remains unclear) into a pre-
tense of \\‘bedevilment,” which
leads them td\a series of accusa-
tions against supposed “witches,”
followed by trial8.and convictions
of witchcraft. The\ scheme snow-
balls because the tifmes are con-
ducive to the hysteria.\ If a gen-
eral message is to be irony lies
in this area.

Man of Courage

More particularly, The Crucible
presents the story of a man, John,
Proctor, who is interesting largely
because he is not a “hero” in the
storybook sensesxof the term. He
is not a man of supreme courage
and impeccable morals. He is not
an atheist, but rather an individ-
ualist in his relations to God.

He is forced by circumstances
into a position in which he must
decide what his principles really
are. He ultimately makes his
choice on the basis of qualities
which he never knew he possessed,
and does so purely on ban basis of
instinct.

The Hedgerow Diath produc-
tion of The Crucik# is memorable
chiefly for its excellent staging.
The whole play is presented
against a solid black backdrop

with simple early American furni-
ture used to denote location.”

Unfortunately, the general qual-
ity of the acting is rather poor.
For the most part, the company
tends to overplay and overdrama-
tize the production. The diction is
much too loud for the small Acad-
emy of Music Foyer. The facial

expressions are grossly exaggerat-
ed and one “aside” is a positively
grotesque. action, accompanied by.
a stage whisper which is practical-
ly a bellow. The first scene is par-
ticularly stilted, probably ‘because
as the situation becomes ‘more en-
grossing, the ‘flaws in production
become less noticeable.

Actors Feeble

The shortcomings of the actors
are particularly. evident in those
scenes which are not carried along
by the plot itself. They fail to
make explicit a great deal which is
latent in the play, particularly the
development of love and under
standing: between Proctor and his
wife.

Undoubtedly, The Crucible would
be far more effective if it were
played with more restraint. In
itself, it is an extremely rhetorical,
often confusing and obscure piece
of work. Nevertheless, its inherent
dramatic qualities are such as not
to be readily hidden and it is a
play well worth seeing.

As there seems to-have been con-
siderable interest, at Bryn Mawr
and elsewhere, in the religion of an
atomic scientist, perhaps the stu-
aents would be interested in some
information about the religious be-
uets of U.S. scientists in general,
wnich was gathered in 1914 and in
14933 by James H. Leuba, Profes-
sor of Psychology at Bryn Mawr
for many years. Each ot a large
number os physicists, biologists;
sociologists, and psychologists was
asked whether he believed in a per-
sonal God and/or in personal im-
mortality, the samples being tak-
en trom names listed in American
men of Science and from member-
ship lists of the American Socio-
logical Society and the American
Psychological Association. In_1933
the percentages of Believers in God
were: physicists, 38%; biologists,
27%; sociologists, 24%; psycholo-
gists, 10%. Percentages. of -disbe-
ulevers (atheists) were 47%, 60%,
67%, and 79%, respectively. The
remainder were doubters (agnos-
tics). Figures for Belief in per-
sonal immortality were'41%, 29%,
25%, and 9%, respectively. It was
also possible to compare the great-
er scientists with the lesser scien-
cists “(e.g., by comparing starred
names in Amer. Men of Sci. with
unstarred); in each science a
smaller proportion of greater sci-
entists Believed. For example, only
17% of the greater physicists Be-
lieved in God, whereas 43% of less-
er physicists Believed. Many other
statistics, for college students and
additional groups, are presented in
Leuba’s The Reformation of the
Churches, Beacon Press, 1950
(posthumous).

Different Knowledge

The percentages of Believers in
1933 were lower than in 1914; it is
possible that this trend has been
reversed since 1933; I doubt that
it-has.

With regard to the order of the
sciences, Professor Leuba _ states,

. . the different kinds of knowl-
edge possessed by these several
classes of people is to be taken
into account. A _ physicist may
think it useless to pray for divine
action in physical nature, for he



knows that-the laws of nature rule
in this sphere; but, because of his
comparative ignorance of biology
and psychology, he is, in those
spheres, more ready to believe in
uod’s action in response to human
supplication. The moral life in
particular may seem outside or be-
yenad the determinism apparent to
him in the physical world. The bi-
o.ogist, however, is aware that nat-
ural causes rule not only jn the
physical world but also in’ living
matter; the sociologist has found
that lawfulness extends even to the
social world; and the psychologist
has learned that human action also
has definite natural causes.”

“Incredible. Myths”

Although very probably the ma-
jority of scholars, in the humani-
ules as well as in the sciences, be-
lieve the prevalent religions. to be
tull of incredible myths, they usu-
ally prefer to keep silent on this
‘subject; many believe that “most
‘people (including college students)
need myths and should not be ‘‘de-
prived” of them; many. just aren’t
imcerested; many believe that re-
ligious beliefs are epiphenomena
wnich don’t realiy matter; some
believe that what they would have
1o say would have no effect any-
way; and many simply lack the in-
vegrity and courage to express
themselves (and this should not be
blamed on McCarthy). As a result,
We are a nation of ignoramuses

about religion and philosophy, our’

teet and heads planted firmly in
the sands of religious myths. Even
simple histori¢al facts unfavorable
to religion have been widely sup-
pressed and are unknown except to
historians and a relatively few oth-
ers; for example, whereas the av-
erage American is led to believe
that the “Founding Fathers”
(Franklin, Washington, Jefferson,
Paine, Adams, Madison, Hamilton,
Morris, Monroe, etc.) were pious
Believers, actually they were _al-
most. without. exception _Deists,
Unitarians, and Freethinkers. Un-
like some of our. more recent
Statesmen, hardly any Believed in
Calvin’s God,

Silverman Protests Against ‘Speech Curtailment’
In Controversial Debate At Sophomores’ Meeting

.| To. the. Editor: .

The issue of class meetings has
long remained dormant—just as
the meetings have remained pass-
ively and/or badly attended. But
this is not the real problem; rather
it is one of the amount of discus-
sion encouraged or permitted on is-
sues of concern to the class and
the school.

The issue was sharply or
to light on Monday, December 6 at
the sophomore class meeting. The
importance of the “curtailment. of
speech” transcends the importance
of the particular meeting. A new
idea was brought up and was un-
der discussion. Obviously, it was
not in accord with the beliefs of
the class body. Before the debate

_|eould be brought to its rightful

conclusion, it was halted. Bring
on the vote-silence the opposition!
—and this is an institution for
“intellectual awakening”.

One might discount my conten-
tion of this “curtailment” and
claim it was due only to expedi-
ency, to the lack of time for class
This can easily be dis-

proved by the fact that the class|

found time for, and even encour-
aged, the continuation of the meet-
ing so that officers might be select-

present” danger or threat to tradi-
tion. The tradition of Bryn Mawr
lies far deeper than the mere con-
tinuation of certain “rites”. It is
to me, instead, the tradition of in-
quiry, of exchange of ideas—of op-
enness to progress through these
new ideas. a

I question not the majority voice
and will, but rather the use of this
will to silence the dissenting mi-
nority and its plea for an adequate
hearing.

Vrofessor MacGregor Makes Public His Dream

To the Editor of the College News:

Some of my students suggested
that I write a ‘reply’ to Mr.
Adams’s letter in your last issue,
so I read the letter.

That very night I had a dream
which I have generously decided,
in the Interests of Science, Prog-
ress, Enlightenment and What-
not, to Make Public, leaving the in-
terpretation as a free-for-all.

I dreamt that I was in the Vati-
can Palace, where the College of
Cardinals was seemingly in con-
clave. The cardinals were all look-
ing rather disconsolately at little
bits of paper on which they each
had to’ write an answer to the ques-
tion, ‘Do you Believe in Psychology"

Although it is perhaps imposs-
ible to prove by science that a god

‘exists, this by no means shows

that it is possible to prove that a
god does not exist by science. Take

for example the particular scien-
tists, ‘who “statistics” say, are
mostly “atheists. Certainly they
accept the world as a. whole, and
can they definitely rule out the ex-
istence of a god?

Physicists. see and explain nat-
ural laws at work, but there is no
way in which these men can get

behind the laws and say why such ‘scientist is similar to an infinite

line, the infinity of which is in-

laws exist.

The biologists can explain the
creation’ of a néW life in terms of
natural laws or patterns. But then
they run up against the factor of
cause and change, in primary cre-
ation and in evolution, which they
cannot explain, leaving room for
belief in a god.

Next we come to the sociologists
who deal with natural laws, but
now as they are at work in society.

Sociologists can find, although
few seem to, reason to believe in
an almighty. This reason comes
from the fact that: this living mat-

ter, man, had, what is to them, an,

unexplainable cause, as do the
natural laws which exist in his re-
lations.

Then there is the psychologist.
He believes he can explain the
mind and its relationship to ‘behav-
ior through natural laws. But here

these natural laws have become]:

something derived from hoe tan-
gibly existing thing. Psychologists
have delved into the realm of the
spiritual and have found a reason

for something material. Here also}

natural laws exist.

It might be worthwhile for those
interested in statistics to further
inquire and see ‘how many mem-
bers of the medical profession,
whose training has included a

background of , physics, chemistry, |

ordination of the sciences in their
service to mankind, how many
members of this ‘profession consid-

er themselves atheists.

The natural laws are accepted
and used in further studies and as
proof of other theories by these
scientists in all their fields. As
they are accepted they lead to the
question of an ordered universe.
None of this proves the existence
of a god, but neither does it prove
that a god does not exist.

There has been a considerable

science: and religion. A good sum-

Warfare of Science and Theology

‘| (Appleton, 1897) (with most of

the shooting done by the theolog-

that theology was not “true relig-
ion’, A more recent statement
stressing conflict or incompatibil-
ity is given by Horace Kaleln in
The Bertrand Russell Case (Vik-
ing Press, 1941),

On the other hand, there are
among both scientists and theolo-

there is no .conflict and/or that
there should be no conflict. (cf.

Dear Editor:

Bumble is my friend. I also

or to chew the bone for a bit.
Sometimes, when he is unavoidably

me in my car, and sometimes, when
he has had an especially tiring day
at college, he waits and drives
home with me. I am always glad
to see him. Once he chased away a
very large dog that was bothering
me. He chased him so splendidly
that I could get out of my car
without speaking to the fellow, to
whom I had never been introduced.
Bumble is my friend, and his
friends are my friends, too.

Contemporary Art
Work On Exhibit

By Paula Dunaway, ’58

Bryn Mawr College,’in celebra-
tion of the Philadelphia Art Fes-
tival, has opened an exhibition of
Twentieth Century art in the Com-
mon Room. The exhibit comprises
contemporary paintings, prints and
sculpture, some from the College-
owned collection and others lent by
members of the faculty and staff.

Included in the show are two
busts by Jacob Epstein; of these,
a portrait of Lucy M. Donnelly,
done in his typical impressionistic
but accurate style, is particularly
impréssive.

Also included are two very sim-
ple but extremely effective pic-
tures, one a lithograph by Roual-
ult, and one an etching by picasso.

One of the outstanding pictures
in the exhibition is a small oil by
»Gris, in typical grey-green-brown
tones, the composition orderly but
subtle; and far from dull. —,

Also of«interest. are a handsome
Milton Avery in surprisingly dark
colors, and a Jackson Pollock wat-

True, the hours from 12:30 to
2:00 are not totally “pernicious”, |
and if two girls can be out. until
12:30, why not until one or two.
Why pick 12:30 as the fatal hour?

It is, however, debatablé whether
two girls, unescorted, are safe in
many parts of Philadelphia even

at 10:30, or for that matter, in.

Bryn Mawr. We know that the
cases where unescorted girls do
actually run into danger are rare.
But doesn’t the very real possibil-
ity, which does exist in fact, of
even ome or two incidents a year,
present sufficient reason for dis-
couraging unescorted girls ‘from
being out late at night?

The “escorted” distinction
may not be meaningful, when it
happens to mean a non-res or oth-
er friend our own age from out-
side the college. Most often, how-
ever, “escorted” does. imply..a car,
and/or a male escort, who is pre-

worth repeating. We see too little
of the paintings kept in Goodhart
basement; since the college owns
works of art, they should be made
available to all. Since Bryn Mawr
does not thave adequate facilities
for a permanent display, we could
certainly benefit from having
these works in view in other places,
perhaps the hall showcases. At
some future time someone might |
be adventurous enough to fulfill
the original intention of this year’s!
student arrangers and import art|
from slightly further distances for |

If we extend these risks: and
wipe out the whole “escorted”
question, aren’t we forgetting the
reason for the rule in the first
place—not to be found, perhaps, on
the dewy heights of the “revolt
against tradition”, but in:the quite
“mature” belief that the intelli-
gence and responsibility of the stu-
dent body are not the only factors
to be admitted in setting a 12:30
limit. . 5
Whether or not we should define
“escorted” more strictly is another
question, but the direction which
it takes has more reasonable foun-
dation than abandoning the dis-
tinction completely.

of the New Yorker’s “Talk of the
Town” department, discussed’ edi-
torial jobs on magazines, while
Miss Denny, a former manager of
a small newspaper and now a re-
porter for Life, spoke on the news-
paper _field..

“Anti-Woman Business”

According to Miss Denny, ‘the
overcrowded newspaper field is
both harder to get into and harder
. to stay in than the magazine field.
“The roughest thing is this anti-
woman business,” she said. “But,”
she went on, “the newspaper busi-
ness is like a disease. Once -you’re
in it, you can’t get out.”

Because of the very nature of
newspaper journalism, jobs for
women are restricted, and if a
woman wishes to do straight re-
porting, she often has to face hard
editors, who remember the worst
actions of female reporters. Wom-
en’s pay is also only about two-
thirds of that of men, and if they
want to change jobs, they find it
very difficult to receive salaries
equal to their experience.

Keep Away From N.Y.C.

If a woman wants to do city re-
porting, any practical political
work will be respeeted, commented
Miss Denny. She added that the
women’s page is offering more op-
portunities for writing, and the
traditional food editorship is open
to“anyone “who can boil water.”

Miss Denny was emphatic in
warning beginners to stay away
from large cities and especially
from New York, where there are
already experienced journalists
from disbanded publications out of
work. She advised beginners to
look up small town papers.and edi-
tors in some handbook such as The
Editors and Publishers Yearbook
and then to work for about three
years on a good, small newspaper.

In working toward the larger
publications, Miss Denny said the
beginner would need a willingness
to do hard and varied work, per-
haps her own financial resources to



in Publishing’ tide her over and “lots of inner re-

sources.”
Miss Atkinson’s first job was on

the New Yorker as a member of

the central office staff; there, like
all beginners, she mailed rejection
slips and did other errands until
she was ready to leave. Then she
was promoted to her present posi-
tion which cowibines editorial and
secretarial duties and. which could
lead to an editorship.

To obtain her job, Miss Atkin-
son, a former editor of thre College
News, wrote to five different pub-
lications that she)liked during her
senior year and found that a Bryn
Mawr record giaranteed an inter-
view. After a satisfactory inter-
view at the New Yorker, she went
to Europe for a year, and on her
return, found that the New York-
er had an opening “for her.

Interview. Deciding. -

Although she ‘had _ registered
with an agency, by starting early
she..was able to find a job on her
own, and she recommended” an
agency only if a job is needed im-
mediately. ‘ «

From her experience, Miss At-
kinsoh concluded that the inter-
view was the most important and
deciding factor in publishing. She
stressed that one should know the
magazine and its field, even if “you
have to stay up two nights before
the interview reading the maga-
zine.” She also advised that the
initial letter be “short, nice and
casual,” containing a resume of
summer jobs and college activities.
She emphasized, too, that the job-
seeker should not imply that she
can improve the magazine.

Miss Denny nated that Time
and Life have training programs,
but competition is very keen. How-
ever, she thought that “the jobs
to get” on these publications are
those of researcher or reporter.
She also noted that beginners
should contact Content Peckham, a
Bryn Mawr graduate, for informa-
tion, on openings on Life and Mar-
ion McFale on Time.

Both speakers made several
points in common, which included:
1) Wanting very much to have an
editorial position is essential; 2)
a knowledge of shorthand is use-
ful, but not. necessary, while a
knowledge of typing is necessary;

Bryn Mawr Invites Russian Student
_ Editors To Visit Campus During Tour

The Bryn Mawr 5h and
Undergraduate Association ha
extended an invitation to the el
en Russian editors to visit
Bryn Mawr campus during th
thirty day tour ofthe Unite
States. In a letter to the Institute
of International Education in New
York, the College expressed a de-
* sire to entertain the editors of the
Soviet student and youth publica-
tions who are expected to stay in
this country from April 15 to May
15.
_ As reported in an article in the
New York Times of March 11, the
~ government, after months of delay,
did not decide until March 10 to
admit the Russians. Attorney Gen-
eral Brownell, at the request of the
State Department, waived provi-
sions of the McCarran-Walter Im-
migration Act in order to permit
the thirty day visit.
Commenting editorially, the
Times remarked: t
-“The Government has decided
that the Republic will not collapse
if eleven Russian students spend
thirty days visiting American col-
leges and universities. ..-. It has
been one of the tragedies of the

In last week’s College News
Linda Levitt echoed the plea for
“a drama workshop, a class in
which techniques of acting or. di-
recting could be learned as taught
by people with background in the
theater.”

We are happy to tell Miss Levitt
and her readers that such a group
is now in existence on an experi-
mental basis. Since last month a
small group of students from both
colleges have been meeting Tues-
day nights in Skinner to work on
technique. This year’s efforts have
been of a trial nature, in prepara-
tion for more extensive operations
in the fall. We hope that interest-
ed students will get in touch with
the undersigned, so they may share
in our plans for the future.

Unfortunately, neither of us has
a very extensive “background in
the theater,” although we have
both been associated with the Col-
lege Theater for years. Still, there
are the books by Russian authors
to look to, as well as help from
outsiders who are connected more
intimately with the stage. In par-
ticular, we would mention Miss
Claudia Franck, a drama consult-
ant from New York, who will b
visiting this spring and whose re-
marks connecting training in act-
ing with undergraduate life should
prove both enlightening and sur-

prising. The time of her visit will ~

be published shortly with an invi-
tation to the whole college com-
munity to attend. i

“Menagerie” Cast
Begins Rehearsals

The cast for Tennessee Williams’
Glass Menagerie, to be given by
the Bryn Mawr College Theatre
and the Haverford College Drama
Club on May 5 and 6, has been
selected.

Tom Wingfield, the son in the
play, will be played by Berkely
Harris; Jim O’Connor, the gentle-
man caller, will be played by Sam
Bishop; Laura Wingfield, tlie

“practical things” in college, Mr.

Leblane said one must distinguish~

between large-scale and_ small-
scale practicalities. The small-scale
ones should be learned before en-
tering college; large-scale practi-
calities should be our concern while
at Bryn Mawr.

Whereas Mr. Leblanc suggested
a five-course plan of study after

_ the freshman year as a possible so-

lution to bridging the science-hu-
manities gap, junior Gail Ames ad-
vocated taking five courses during
the first two years. She felt this
would be profitable during the be-
ginning survey courses. Noting
that one can’t disagree with a pro-
fessor if one doesn’t have a con>
siderable foundation of knowledge,
she suggested abolishing.some re-
quirements, taking more courses
allied with one’s major, and there-

by preparing to reach some real |:
in required courses stressing facts

conclusions, especially during the
last two years. |
Senior Charlotte Busse noted
that one is very liable at some
times to, become dissatisfied with
the c set-up, and overwhelm-
ed Ay the amount of knowledge
feels one lacks. Granting that
cannot learn everything, she
defended the present requiréments
and did not favor a_ five-course

one needs to become acclimated to

ated by making better use of the
college community and nearby
Philadelphia, Admittirig that we
perhaps lack contemporary cours-
es, she felt we shouldn’t “split the
field” so as to take part in more,
and generally appeared optimistic
about the Bryn Mawr system.
Sarah Stifler proceeded to “de-
fend the requirements, but from a
radical ‘viewpoint.” She wanted

creased experimentation. For ex-
ample, she criticized the first year
philosophy course as putting too

philosophers rather than the his-

Last week’s editorial on the Al-
liance raised an important point
about the role of the organization
but we feel that the dichotomy of
purpose and_ responsibility _ has
been over-simplified. Board mem-
bers and non-board members have
discussed the -problem at great
length, and while we have general-
ly agreed that club activities and
smaller group work should be
geared to meet the demands of
students already interested in po-
litical affairs, we have felt that the
rest of the college should not be
disregarded.

In a college community, along
with our academic curriculum, we
have a unique opportunity to. con-
sider political and social problems,
without the pressure of some of
the more practical demands in life.
The Alliance acquires its purpose
from the fact that we have this op-
portunity to evaluate world affairs
in an intellectual atmosphere.

Certainly an. organization co-
ordinating political activities
should provide programs on the
“discussing” and “doing” levels,
but it is also responsible for pro-
viding “food--for thought” for
many students who might become
interested in ideas if'a political or

to the problems. For this reason,
it seems important to continue
such programs~as ‘Current Events
and the assembly series.

As to the nature of speakers, it
must be possible to strike a happy
medium between the celebrity and
the lesser-known personality.
When we start writing letters,
however, we find that many well-
qualified analysts are not able to
visit Bryn Mawr for one reason or
another. Some years the Speakers
Committee is more successful than
in other years in obtaining the
speakers they want. most. Devel-
oping more activity around a lec-
ture is worthwhile, but in order
to achieve a program such as Hav-
erford’s Phillips visitors, we would
need a Mr. Phillips to endow the
Alliance with equivalent funds. If
you can recommend a benefactor,
the Alliance board will receive him
gratefully, since Alliance ordinar-
ily depends on the Common Treas-
ury.

Suggestions for any kind of ac-
tivity, speakers, and topics for lec-
tures or discussion are always wel-
comed by the board.

WBMC Manager Announces Next Year’s Plans;
Includes Wiring Of Pems, Rock, And Denbigh

To all those interested in listen-
ing to the radio:

How many students at Bryn
Mawr have listened to WBMC this
year? Unfortunately very few.
But the staff of the radio station
has continued with its admirable
work; broadcasting a large variety
of programs in the. traditional
high standard of our station. It
has been owing to a number of
faults in our wiring system that
much of the campus has not been
able to listen in to us.

Since we have been able to lo-
cate these faults, next fall during

Freshman week and the following

week-ends, with the kind help of
Haverford College, we are plan-

ning to rectify these. By the time
that College opens, Pembroke East
and West, Rockefeller and Denbigh
should be able to tune in to 580
with good results. Then if the



weather is still like this, don’t be
surprised to see us digging our
way from Denbigh to Merion the
next weekend! It seems likely that
if our finances are good we shall
be able to reach Radnor by the end
of the year.

With the promise of a good lis-
tening audience I sincerely hope
that hext year we shall be seeing
all our old staff members, and a
large number of new ones.. Every-
one is welcome whether she has

had experience or not. We should’

be very pleased, if you feel that
you do not have time to join the
staff, that you make some sugges-
tions about what you would like to
hear at 580 on your AM dial.
With very best wishes from the
Board of WBMC for a wonderful
summer.
Yours sincerely, -
Elizabeth B. Thomas,
Station Manager.



ltalian Movie ‘Romeo And Juliet’
“Exquisitely’’ Done; Acting Superb

Renato Castellani, with his di-
rection of the Italian version of
“Romeo and Juliet,” has created a
show with unlimited appeal for the
twentieth century audience.
Awarded the grand prize at the
Venice Film Festiva] this year, the
movie is a masterpiece of exquis-
ite detail and glowing splendor.

Although lacking many of
Shakespeare’s immortal lines, the
film moved so briskly that the
omissions were more than made up
for. Most notable of the lines left
out was Mercutio’s famous “Queen
Mab” speech, a modification which
the English writers particularly
criticized.

Made in Veroma and Venice the
movie has hardly been equaled for
sheer spectacle. The authentic set-
tings in the ancient monastery on
the island of San Francisca del De-
serto near Venice and in the Col-
onnade of Verona’s San Zeno Mag-

giore Church help particularly to

bring the three-hundred-and-fifty-
year-old tragedy to life. The cos-
tumes were near perfection, and in
the ballroom scene Julia stood out
beautifally in her white satin gown
in contrast with the red dresses of
the other women.

All of the principals were little-
known English actors. Susan Shen-
tall played Juliet and Laurence



Harvey, Romeo. Apart the» were
good; together they were magnifi-
cent.

Susan looked just young enough
for the part of Juliet. Her plati-
num blond hair and sweet. face
gave the desired effect of “sweet
innocence,” while her acting re-
vealed an amazing feeling for deep
emotional expression.

Laurence was a clever, amorous
and tragic Romeo. He was clever
in the ballroom scene, which was
tastefully done, when he met Ju-
liet. He could not have been more
amorous on the balcony and the
tragic suicide scene had the effect
of completing his character.

The supporting actors all did)

their jobs well. Especially notable
was the portrayal of Friar Lau-
rence.

Life Of Alaskan
Indians Pictured
In Photo Exhibit

An exhibit of the photographs
taken on the ethnological and ar-

Alaska is now being shown on the
second floor of the library. These
pictures were taken in the summer
of 1939 and 1952 and in the winter
and spring of 1954.

Among. the most. striking pic-
tures “in the exhibit were those of
the snow covered Alaskan land-
scapes. Also interesting are the
pictures of the natives and their
children, some in native and some
in European dress.

This settlement on the Guld
Coast of Alaska is the home of the
Tlinglit Indians. 250 live there
now, descendants of 600 ancestors
who form the northernmost settle-

ment of the tribe. Pictures of In-
dian masks, art, and clothes show
the life and culture of these In-
dians.

Society was changed by the in-
troduction of a salmon cannery /in
1902. The operations of salmon
fishing and the salmon cannery are
shown in these pictures. A picture
of a member of the expedition fish-
ing for seaweed is included, with a
caption which assures the viewer
that it tastes quite good when eat-
en mixed with salmon eggs.

These Indians are now a back-
water people, poor and unable eith-

turn to the happy days of the last

For Norristown Group
To\the Editor:

This is written for the benefit of
the students of Bryn Mawr College
who have one afternoon of the
week free and who would be will-
ing to donate that time to the peo-
ple of Norristown State Hospital.

As I have said to some of you
before, I think of this as the rich
giving to the poor. We at Bryn
Mawr have some of the finest edu-
cational advantages possible while
the people at Norristown have very

few. It seems only fitting that we
give some of ourselves to them if
only once a month. Often their
only outside exercise during - the
winter is when college girls take '
them walking and often we are
their only outside contacts. And
another matter is the young girls
who have few or no educational
advantages. If there are enough of
you interested, there is the possi-
bility of arranging some classes,
perhaps once a month, in which we
could teach them something con-
structive.

Those of you who would like to
join the walking group and have
not contacted me already, I would
appreciate your sending me a note
in campus mail with your name,
hall, and free afternoons. I espe-
cially appeal to those of you who
know the sad conditions in most

Junior Class Fairy Tale Is Not At All Grim;
Talent Of Cast Praised, But Plot ‘Inadequate’

Ferguson, MacVeagh
Win Reviewers’
Tributes
by Leah Shanks and Molly Epstein

The Class of ’57 is, in many
ways, atypical of Bryn Mawr as a
whole, This fact is perhaps a key
to Knock on Rock, the Juniors’
“Grim_ Fairy. Tale.”

The class as a whole is the most
spirited to appear on campus in
the past few years, and appraising
a class show from the point of
view of the general enthusiasm
and fun of producing it has much
to be said for it.

From this point of view, Knock
on Rock was a. very successful
show.

The caliber of the acting was ex-
ceedingly high, without even add-
ing the qualifying “for an amateur
production”. Most outstanding was
Rabbit MacVeagh as an _ horren-
dous “Grandma”, with an appro-
priate amount of sadistic cackling.
Patty Ferguson as “Satan” was ex-
cellent, both in meek subordination
to Grandma and in determined
leadership of a “wild Western”
posse against her.

Betty Brackett, Judy Harris and
Mickey Nusbaum, as the three



geologists, respectively, Catalda,
Emily and Mafalda, showed a great
deal of stage presence and each
lent her own personality to her
part.

“Minor” characters, such as Vir-
gil (Joyce Cushmore), Lady Tour-
ist (Anita Kaplan), Carey Thomas
(Liz Kaplan), and Dante (Leone
Edricks), were all most entertain-
ing.

Singing talent was also notable.
Particularly outstanding as solo-
ists were the three geologists and
Lynne Sherrerd as a “torchy” Hel-
en of Troy. The level was kept up
by Patty and Rabbit. The spirited
angel and devil choruses were an-
other tribute to 57’s enthusiasm.

Much credit for the excellence
of the singing and acting perform-
ances is due to Lucy Lindner, mus-
ical director, and Pat Moran, the
show’s director.

Students Find Show
Review Too Critical

Madam Editor:

We were extremely disappointed
with the manner in which The Col-
lege News critically reviewed the

Junior Show, Knock on Rock. In
this article, we failed to -see the
necessity of the offensive sarcasm
employed.

‘The remarks: “Perhaps the show
took the Dean’s office by storm be-
cause of the decidedly ‘hayseed’
quality of its few jests,” and
“homespun philosophy” — “big
souls in small bodies,” are indica-
tive of the uncalled for and ‘chip-

on-shoulder’ sarcasm which per-

vaded the review.
Honest, objective criticism is de-

sired, sought after, and appreciat-'

ed, but criticism merely for the
sake of-criticism. isnot!

The October 26 edition of the
College News passed my desk to-
day, along with many other college
newspapers. Ordinarily I. would
have glanced through its pages for
usable — news,
However, I was struck by the front
page review of Knock on Rock.

I was privileged to attend the
Saturday performance: of this pro-
duction and was curious to read
what others had to say about it.

Miss Shanks and Miss Epstein
started out in typical critic style,
semi-enthusiastic. Then they broke
into genuine praise. But, unfor-
tunately, it.seems that their loyal-
ty to the senior class caught up to
them on page six.

As one who has no more interest
in either Bryn Mawr or its junior

‘class than the desire to reward

honest labor, I object to the pan-
ning given Knock on Rock.

The reviewers note a lack of
“creative aspects.” How can a pro-
duction of this type be creative?
Original settings? Original songs?
The show had both. The true cre-
ative test of a variety show of this
nature is in the actions and sing-
ing of the cast. By these stand-
ards Knock deserves commenda-
tion.

The “grim fairy tale” had no
plot (I didn’t even note a “thin
thread of plot’). It would be fool-
ish to look for one in a production
of this type. This conglomeration
was exactly what it purported to
be, a variety show. Yet it was not
merely a succession of acts. Grand-
ma and her boys provided a set-
ting for the entire show and the
three geologists served as quiet
(?) transition elements. Both the
angel and devil choruses composed
a pretty white and red ribbon to
neatly tie the package.

New Kitchen

Patty Ferguson fit into her part
like a bride in a new G.E. kitchen.
It wouldn’t have looked good with-
out her. And as for Rabbit Mac-
Veagh, I’ll bet next Christmas’s
shirt (usually a $4.95 Manhattan)
that many a man’s thoughts went
back to his mother-in-law as he
watched Grandma. What a witch
of a woman!

My heart went out to Dante each
time he whined for his beloved.
(Has Beatrice been found yet?)
Sweet Elsie offered a fine contrast
to this mournful lover. The re-
maining characters (and that they
were) did no harm to the show,
but added little more than an ex-
tra chuckle or two. —

I was sitting close enough to ob-
serve Lucy Lindner in directing ac-
tion. Her face manifested com-

‘plete oblivion to all but the show.

The music knew its master at all
times. I didn’t observe Patricia
Moran doing her job, but the re-
sults rate her the applause she re-
ceived.

Perhaps there .were too many
songs. That would account for the
Shanks-Epstein theory of lack of
tune. I enjoyed the lyrics as well

as the music. Two numbers.in-par-————-
ticular clung to my dainty ears:

“Hell was Hell”
Got You.”
Not being a Bryn Mawr student

and “Grandma’s

(I was never considered attractive —

enough for the campus) and hav-
ing lost contact with the school in
recent years, I missed several lines
that sent most of the audience into
cackling revolutions. Even at that,
though, I found myself laughing ©
during most of the show.

Why must college students insist
on finding-an inner meaning in ev-
erything ? Knock on Rock was pro-
duced for amusement only. “Big

Brancusi Exhibition
Opens At Museum

The Philadelphia Museuem of
Art opened on Jan. 27 an exhibi-
tion of the work of Constantin
Brancusi, pioneer sculptor of ab-
stract forms. The _ exhibition,
which ‘will close Feb. 26, includes
loans from the great collections of
Brancusi’s work, both here and
abroad, and the artist himself has
lent a large group of works.

Brancusi is 79 years old and liv-
ing in Paris. He was a student of
Rodin but early turned to the op-
posite extreme of abstract sculp-
ture,
subject of controversy for years,
culminating in the celebrated deci-
sion of the U. S. Customs authori-
ties that it was not art. The fa-
mous trial which followed ended in
a favorable opinion for the artist.
Today Brancusi is acclaimed as
probably the greatest living sculp-
tor.

The exhibition was assembled by
James Johnson Sweeney, Director
of. the Solomon R. Guggenheim
Museum, in collaboration with the
staff of the Philadelphia Museum
of Art.

_According to Mr. Sweeney,
“Brancusi’s sculpture is the art of
a man born close to nature who
has always remained close to na-
ture.” In the simple forms of his
work great emphasis is laid on the
materials used, the individual col-
or, the grain of marble or the tex-
ture of stone or wood.
Important among the 50-odd
pieces in the exhibition are the
towering wood King of Kings, the
Two Penguins of marble, Endless
Column, the wood Head, Adam and
Eve, Cock, one of the many ver-
sions of Mademoiselle Pogany, the
Bird in Space of polished brass,
the Yellow Bird of yellow marble,

All-College Voting :
System Is Criticized

To whom it may concern—and this
concerns the whole college:
This is in reference to the pres-

ent trend towards all-college elec-
tions ot ofticers who represent
groups whose active members do
not make up a majority of.the col-
lege. At the present time, the
chairman ot Chapel Committee, the
first sophomore to Self-Gov., and
the first sophomore to .Undergrad
are elected by the college as a
whole, If these officers are to func-
tion adequately as representatives
of their groups, it seems only log-
ical that they snould be elected by
their groups.
_ In regard to the sophomore rep-
resentatives; a large portion of the
upperclassmen are: not sufficiently
acquainted with these candidates
and therefore, are not competent
to judge whether or not they rep-
resent the majority opinion of the
class. lt would seem, therefore,
that the only students competent
to judge are the freshmen.

The election of the chairman ol
Chapel Committee by the college
as a whole presents a similar mis-
representation, In view of the
small percentage of active partici-
pants in Chapel Committee, the
chairman may not be known to the
student in her role on the commit-
‘tee, although a great proportion of
the student body may be acquaint-”
ed with her. Therefore, we feel
that the Chapel.Committee should
elect its own chairman.

At the present time, emphasis is
placed upon all-college elections of
officers, about whom the student
body is not adequately informed
and more important, in whom the
students are not interested. We
therefore feel that the election of
these officers should. be by the
group directly involved, or that it
should be the individual student’s
responsibility to vote only when
informed and interested.

Letter From

French Morocco

. By Darrall Kidd, 58
Fes; French Morocco

The French part of Morocco,
which for the last. months has been
an area of world tension, seems
peaceful, superficially. Five times
a day the Measians come out--on
the minarets and call down into
the medina that it is time to pray.
Camels amble leisurely through the
narrow, lattice-roofed streets, put-
ting their padded feet carefully on

jthe cobblestones. |... .

However, through this scene of
traditional Arab life, unchanged
since the time of Christ, walks the
French soldier. At night, as the
Measians call for evening prayer,
French bugles also echo through
the city. Every day incidents oc-
cur between ‘the two ‘groups,
French and Arab, and the breech
grows wider.

There are several disturbing ele-
ments in the situation in Morocco,
and more especially in Fez. Moroc-
co, until a short while ago, was
controlled by, and divided between,
Spain and France. Morocco is now
nominally independent, but French
and Spanish troops still remain.

The present appears to he the
moment for Arab leaders through-
out. the world . to
strength, and everywhere they are
taking dramatic stands on policy.
Often” these “stands are’ rash, or
merely an attempt to rally support
from the nationalism which is cer-
tainly taking hold in the Arab
world.

Clash Threatens

Here in Morocco, the Spanish
are comparatively welcome, for
they work well with the Arabs;
and there exists a real understand-
ing between them. Not so the
French. The same Arab leaders
who successfully pressured for in-
dependence now want the complete
withdrawal: of all French troops.
At the same time the French are
spending close to one and a half
million dollars daily in this part
of the world. With two such pow-
ers opposing each other, a crisis
of serious proportions would seem
to be inevitable.

A few days ago the nationalist
leader who had been exiled by the
French returned to North Africa,
He opposes the. Sultan and the
more conservative elements. The
Arabs in Fez have turned strange-
ly cool to Europeans and the
streets are gaudy with the green
star on a red background, which
is the flag of Morocco. Even the
beggars now stay away from all
Europeans and stop their chant

of the Nationalist leader are being
sold on the streets, and at night
there are large Arab Political
meetings.

Attitude Clarified

What clarifies the attitude of the
Arab here, and gives real force to
the suspicion of unrest and rebel-
lion, is the ever-present shadow of
Nasser. Beside a picture of the
Sultan of Morocco, there is inevit-
ably a picture of Nasser, and his
name also appears on the sides of
trains and mud huts. Most of the
talk in the Arab section is of
Egypt's strong man. His face is
in store windows, and even from a
‘throng of brightly dressed mar-
riage attendants, a poster ‘was
‘thrust.into our gr group of watching
Europeans. ra
Chances that the present prob-
lem in North Africa may be solved
peacefully seem rather dim. The
Arab world is learning that it com-
mands a substantial force in the
world arena. Its assets are oil,
geographic position, and, most im-
portant, a dedicated population
that is willing to follow, and that
believes in the rising star of si
Arab world.

Chemist Speaks
On Disarmament

Dr. Charles Price, chairman of
|the chemistry department at the
‘University of Pennsylvania, in the
discussion sponsored by the Bryn
Mawr-Haverford International Re-
lations, Club, “Is _Disarmament.Un-

specific conditions are met. He
named these as economic and social
justice and universal acceptance of

can be no thoughts of disarmament
until peace is insured in the world.

According to Dr. Price, the U.N.
is the only practicable instrument
for achieving world peace. At pres-
ent, voluntary cooperation and
unanimous agreement (in the Se-
curity _Council)_are required of
that organization if it is to act ef-
fectively. As these principles do
not work in the world at large, the
organization should not be con-
demned for impotence, but rather
sovereignty should be delegated to
it. The speaker claimed that sur-
veys have shown that the Ameri-
can people are in favor of a more
powerful U.N. that would be this
effective instrument for maintain-
ing law and order and deterring
strife.

Disarmament has been discussed
since the end of World War II. Ad-
mittedly little has been done, but
the consensus should not be that
we are now starting from scratch.
While there has been no formal
U.N. .charter revision, the United
States itself adopt a policy of
heavier reliance upon the world or-
ganization. Dr. Price cited the re-
cent immediate use of the U.N. in
the Hungarian and Middle Eastern
crises as exemplary. He denounced
the old diplomacy, the bilateral
agreements and compacts. He also
suggested that economic aid be
channelled through the U.N., that
support for colonial peoples be
guided by principle rather than ex-
pediency, that a U.N. agency to
govern international waterways be
organized.

‘Hamlet’ Presented By Stratford Players

T. S. Eliot has written of Ham-

with Mr. Eliot’s.

Conventional conceptions of a
performance of Hamlet insist that
the central role be played with a
definite interpretation. One must
be a philosophical Hamlet, a crafty
Hamlet, a revengeful Hamlet or an
Oedipus-complex Hamlet. After a

Friendly Persuasion

By Jana Varlejs



Warm, home-spun humor, a re-
lief from the common | slapstick,
type, gives Friendly Persuasion a
charm which sets it apart from the
usual Hollywood “productions.”
This charm, however, is achieved
at the loss of forceful development
of theme. :

The story centers about a Quak-
er family faced with standing firm
on their pacifist convictions at the
cost of their home and lives, as

approaches their farm. The con-
flict in the film itself is well de-
veloped, but instead of conclusion,
contradiction is evident, and the
characters do not appear to have
been much affected by their ex-
periences. Everyone “lives happily

ever after,” an anti-climax which
is a little disappointing after a few
dramatic war scenes.
Nevertheless, a fairly even bal-
ance between comedy and attempt
at a more serious overtone is
achieved. At times the “friendly
persuasion” is quite obvious, dem-
onstrating the Quaker renunciation
of fighting and their “other: cheek”
theory. Fortunately, the humorous
incidents do not. interfere with this
aspect, nor does the very “Holly-
woodish” scenery, which make the
modest Quaker homestead look like
a French landscape by one of the
old masters.

Gary Cooper

Gary Cooper, as the father, man-
ages to convey a boyish sheepish-
ness along with mature honesty.
He admits that his faith is weak,
but when he has the opportunity
to kill a rebel, the strength of his
Quaker convictions finally comes to
the surface.

As his wife, Dorothy McGuire,
although a stricter Quaker than
Cooper ,is often won over by his
“friendly persuasion.” Her love for
him makes her yield to some of
his un-Quaker-like whims, such as
buying an organ or racing to Meet-
ing. This very human susceptibil-

Athenian College
Asks For Our Aid

To the President’ of the Student
Council:

We request your courtesy in
publishing this letter in, your Stu-
denl Council ee because
we think that our _fellow-students
in America ‘should be acquainted
with the facts in an international
problem which we consider of vital
importance not only to Greece but
to” every freedom-loving” people—
the Cyprus question.

The fact that Cyprus was, has
been, and still is a purely Greek

island, with a population that, de-
spite subjugation to other states,
is still four-fifths Greek, is an un-
deniable historical fact. We believe
that it is equally evident that the

human rights of life, liberty and
the pursuit of happiness are pre-
rogatives- of all peoples, and that
America, a country that herself
has bitterly fought for her liberty
and independence, will regard every
rightful struggle of a people for
freedom and for the right to de-
cide about its future as natural
and noble.

The people of Cyprus, who. for
years have been vainly trying. by
peaceful means to make their voice
heard, are now engaged in a strug-
gle for their inalienable right to
determine their own future. Their
foreign rulers are trying to sup-
press their voice by cruel force and
ruthless violence. .We understand,
while strongly disapproving, their
concern to keep under their control
a people whom they “acquired” in
1878, in a bargain with another
country. But what we,cannot un-
derstand is why the American peo-
ple are turning a deaf ear to the
desperate pleas of this tormented
island, and how your democratic
country can view in apathy such
flagrant violations of the human
rights as the abduction and exile,
without. charge or trial, of Arch-
bishop Makarios, the religious and
national head of the people of the
island; the infliction of wholesale
punishment on the _ population,
without discrimination between the
guilty and the innocent; the medie-
val punishments, such as the flog-
ging of young children; the execu-
tion of young men whose only
crime has been their love for lib-
erty and independence.

We Appeal...

We appeal to you because we
believe firmly that your own val-
liant fight for independence has
not been in vain; that the princi-
ples established by the French Rev-
olution, and those promulgated by
the Charter of Human Rights, and
ideals of enlightened people should
not and cannot be overruled by
political intrigue and material in-
terests.

“ We ask for your support in this
matter as the Cyprus question
comes up for discussion before the
General Assembly of the United
Nations. If you believe that all
men are born equal and free to
choose thier own way of life, if
you value liberty and the enjoy-
ment of human rights on the part
of individuals and nations, we ask

your own circle to make the facts
of the case known and to impress _
your friends with the responsibil-
ity resting upon all democratic
nations to seek to restore justiee.
We ‘ask you to remember that your
own country has had to go through
a similar period of struggle for its
independence, and that ‘we, the
young people of Greece, like those
of every country, are ardently de-
voted to the high ideals of justice
and liberty.

Protects Foreign

By Elizabeth Foshay,
’ NSA Co-ordinator
The United States National Stu-
dent Association is the only or-
ganization in the United States
which gives the students of col-
leges and universities all over tke
country a chance to come together

and exchange their ideas on. the
many areas which concern the role
of students.

Domestically the organization
concerns itself with such problems
as the setting up or improvement
of student governments, student
housing, fraternities and sororities
and even parking problems. Inter-
nationally it is concerned with
seeking to protect the interests of
students everywhere with regard
to rights which all hold in com-
mon. These include the right to
study, the right to engage in un-
hampered research, and all other
rights which constitute the concept
of academic freedom. :

The yearly congress of the or-
ganization is the place at which all
the ideas come together. Here the
delegates of member schools ex-
change ideas and write them into
resolutions. Here too, the foreign
visitor may stand and give his

Holyoke’s Wyckoff
Explains Antigone,
Important Fate Role

Sophocles’ Antigone is a play in
which “the right is upheld by the
young and weak as against the
strong and secure”.
alize in considering it, that Anti-
gone is a girl of fifteen. These ob-
servations were made by Elizabeth
Wyckoff, Bryn Mawr graduate and
Ph. D., now a Professor of Greek
at Mt. Holyoke, who delivered the
Horace White Memorial Lecture
in Goodhart, Thursday evening,
Feb. 7.

In admitting that a knowledge
of certain conceptions in Greek so-
cial history is necessary to the in-
terpretation of the play as Soph-
ocles intended it, Miss Wyckoff, who
has herself published a translation
of the Antigone, said that: Greek
maidens of fifteen, the only available
basis for Sophocles’ portrayal,
neither fell in love nor took it upon
themselves to perform the rites of
burial. The rashness and strength
of Antigone’s act is made forceful
by its denial of custom and by its
contrast to the traditional maiden-
ly behavior of her sister, Ismene.
Antigone is under pressure both
from her social position and from
her family past, but not from love
of her betrothed. Although an
Athenian girl of fifteen was ready
for marriage she was not expected
to love her husband. Marriage
might represent for her the normal
fulfillment of life—but nothing
else.

. This horror of leaving life in-
complete, however, is enough: to
draw Antigone, once she has been
sentenced, away from “the love of
death fervent and frequent in the
very young”; yet in this matter
she is not an ordinary young per-
son as she has more friends dead



the annual | than alive. Also she has the-tem=|

per of her dead family—that qual-
ity from which has sprung all their
action and’ their tragedy. If she
is stern and hard it is with the
“sterness of truth and the hard-
ness of reality”.

In seeing a higher law in the Oedi-
pus cycle and establishing the char-
acters as fated, Sophocles has seen
his characters as those whose na-
tures are formed to respond to
great necessity with great deeds.
‘The gods see that the higher law
is finally upheld, but it takes an
Antigone to uphold it.”

gin the agitation for democratic
rights, and they are followed and
looked to by the majority of the
people of their nation. Their stu-
dent unions have a power which
their governments must take into
consideration.

Center of Moral Support

As thany governments look to
che United States for moral sup-
port in internal conflicts, so do
vheir student unions look to the
USNSA...for.-the--moral ‘support
offered them through our resolu-
tions. Very often the circulation of
these resolutions has the effect of
deciding the attitude of a govern-
ment toward its university stu-
dents.

The struggle of the Hungarian
students for academic freedom was
strongly supported by USNSA. It
was this struggle which touched
off the Hungarian revolt against
its Communist regime. The moral
support of the USNSA was prob-
ably one of the factors which kept
che people fighting even against
insurmountable odds. The effect of
these resolutions shows, in itself,
their importance. Although the or-
ganization has no way of enforcing
its resolutions, the weight of such
proof of approval is enough to keep
tudents of other nations fighting
‘or academic freedoms until they
get them or until they are com-
pletely and utterly suppressed by
government forces.

It would seem to this writer
that if. an organization has such
importance in the world commun-
ity, this fact is enovfgh in itself to
warrant a certain degree of im-
portance on every American
campus.

Mme. Jambor Is
Lecturer In Music

Announcement has been made by
Miss McBride, of the appointment
of Mme. Agi Jambor, concert pian-
ist and composer, as Lecturer in
Music at the College. Mme. Jambor,
a Hungarian by birth who now
lives in Baltimore, Maryland, will
join the faculty next September.

Known for her interpretation of
Bach, Mme. Jambor appeared as
soloist with many of the major
symphony orchestras in this coun-
try and has played at the Bach
Festivals in Bethlehem, Pennsyl-

supervised the music school at
Oak Ridge, Tennessee, and is pre-
cently on the faculty of the Pea-
body Conservatory of Music in
Baltimore.

Miss Sylvia W. Kenney; of Wash--
ington, D.C., has also been appoint-
ed as Assistant Professor of Music.
Dr. Kenney, a Ph.D. from Yale and
a former Fulbright Scholar, was
recently cataloguer of Bach manu-
scripts and music at Baldwin-Wall-

Basketball Squads Defeated by Drexel|

Flushed with their recent tri-
umphs over Ogontz Center and the
Bryn Mawr Nurses, the Athena All
Stars and the Minerva Monsters
(Bryn Mawr’s world-famous bas-
ketball varsity and J.V.) played
Drexel Institute in two rousing
games last Thursday. Although
both ‘teams played with their
characteristic dynamic enthusiasm,
the All Stars were beaten by
Drexel, 47 to 26, while the Mon-
sters were edged out 44 to 41.

Even though ft has been sug-
gested that perhaps the Drexel
teams were so over-awed by their
‘ opponents’ fluent Greek cheers that
they were unable to appreciate the
subtlety of our varsity’s plays, the
fact remains that neither Bryn
Mawr team played a very good
game. The second team made a
better showing than the varsity,

picking up after a slow start to
come near winning the game in
the last agonizing minutes of play.

Mary Masland was outstanding
in the J.V. game, piling up a total
of 21 points for Bryn Mawr. The
varsity, although it did nothing
‘ really badly, did nothing really well
either, but was handicapped most
of all by the low percentage of
baskets the Bryn Mawr forwards
were able to make.

“The teamwork in both games,

however, was very much better
than in the previous matches. An
improvement in individual skills
should make the teamwork effect-
ive and profitable.

A Hy

giene Exam
Is Not Pointless

fo the Editor: ©

Congratulations to The College
News for bringing up the question
of hygiene exams long enough
ahead of time so that all the grum-
ting is not done during the test!
Points made in the News editorial
are valid, but the other side of
the question also seems to deserve
consideration and expression.
Speaking from experience, I had
never considered myself woefully
ignorant of hygienic matters, or
felt at a loss in conversation be-
cause I did not know why enzymes
attack what sorts of foods, etc.
But the nominal amount of time
it took me to discover this and
other seemingly unimportant facts
has been negligible enough in com-
parison with the value of the
knowledge so that I can refrain
from any vociferous complaints
about the exam.

The statement that “no one
jearns anything from the hygiene
exam, that she could not very well
find out for herself,” seems to be
applicable to many other things
learngd at Bryn Mawr; the ques-
tion is, how many of us would find
out for ourselves? It does seem
wrong that a girl should be kept’
from registering for her senior
year because this requirement, is
not met. Does this mean that the
idea of the hygiene exam makes
sense, the technicalities do not?

The fund drive for the Bryn
Mawr Summer Camp begins next
week, and as is well known, the
future of the camp is dependent
upon the student body’s response
to this monetary appeal. As a
past direcor who has directly wit-
nessed the genuine worth of a few
weeks of sun and sea, instruction
and creative group-living to an in-
verracial group of country-and-
attention-starved children, I- should
like to express my belief in the
very real value of -this college ac-
tivity both as a charitable institu-
tion and as a basic part of Bryn
Mawr College.

Although the actual location fo

the camp has been changed many
times, Bryn Mawr girls have con-
tinued to provide valuable camp-
ing experiences for Philadelphia’s
underprivileged children for more
than half a century. In What
Makes a College (p. 245) Miss
Meigs describes the formation of
the Christian Union in 1891 and
speaks of the summer camp’s be-
ginnings as a part of the college’s
charitable activities. Furthermore,
I am sure that Miss McBride will
not mind my mentioning her coun-
selorship at the camp during her
undergraduate days. ~~

Although we fondly joke about
the Bryn Mawr tradition of tra-
ditions, this is perhaps one of the
few which continues to have a
practical significance for persons
outside the college community. It
is one of the few opportunities that
Bryn Mawr students have, while
still undergraduates, to go beyond
the college boundaries in a repre-
sentative group and to put into
practice some of their cherished
idealistic views about democracy
and education.

“Wesleyan University
Middletown, Conn.
Dear Editor:

In an age possessing the power
of tnthinkable destruction, it must
be the primary concern of every
citizen of this country to establish
international understanding, and
to abolish the ever-present possi-
bility of war. The United States
today is in a position to lead the
way towards peace, and it must
meet this grave responsibility. We
feel that our present foreign pol-
icy, founded as it is on the strug-
gle to maintain military suprem-
acy, is leading us towards, rather
than away from, war.”

The outcome of every arms race
in history has been war, and this

same direction. The accumulation
of military strength implies the
threat of using that strength as a
means for protecting our interests.
It is unthinkable that we fully in-
tend to unleash the destructive
powers of our atomic weapons on
even our most bitter enemies.

Yet even if we do not intend this,
and our threat is a bluff, it is naive
to suppose that this bluff will
eventually be called. When it is
called, we will be compelled to car-
ry out our threats, and the use of
arms will cease to be a bluff. It
will be a necessity. Our race for
military supremacy draws us in-
evitably to the use of military pow-
er.
Our military policy has repeated-
ly failed to achieve its objectives.

Open Letter to Bryn Mawr College

In the world today there are few
remaining frontiers to female
equality. One of the last is the
mental sport of CHESS—the old-
est game extant in its original
form, the most ingenious and com-
plex game invented by the human
mind,

The Pennsylvania State Chess
Federation is interested in the
formation of a Chess Club at Bryn
Mawr. (To the best of my knowl-
edge. this will be the first at a
women’s college.)- The PSCF will
support you in the organization of
a club and its program and furnish
aid in the acquirement of chess
sets and books. Also, the men in
the Haverford College Chess Club
have volunteered to teach begin-
ners this fascinating game.

The, Philadelphia Metropolitan
Intercollegiate Chess League this
year includes teams from Haver-
ford and St. Joseph’s Colleges and
from the Universities of Pennsyl-
vania, Temple and Ogontz Center
of Penn State. The winner ‘in’ this
feague will receive the Girard K.
Rosenblum Trophy and will com-
pete with other regional winners
for the Pennsylvania Intercolleg-
iate Chess Championship. The de-
fending champion is the Univer-
sity of Pennsylvania.

Looking forward to the entry of
a Bryn Mawr College Chess Team,
I remain, or

Yours in the interest of chess,

Morde Treblow,
V. Pres., PSCF College Program

Those interested in creating a
Bryn Mawr Chess club, please sign
up on lists posted on the hall
bulletin boards.

The Reverend Lowell Lentz of

took the place of the regular Sun-

Petition Attempts
To Halt Apartheid

T6 the students of Bryn Mawr:

For the past several years, the
Nationalist Party headed by
Strijdom has been in control of the
government of the Union of South
Africa. The legislation of this
party thas been very definitely in
favor of the small group of Euro-
peans (white men) and of widen-
ing the gap between the white. and
non-European population.

Native primary and _ secondary
schools are alresly partially con-
trolled by the government, which
means that they are given an edu-
cation . unequal to that of the
Afrikaan “and English population.
They are not taught English in
their schools and therefore haye
great difficulty communicating
with anyone but other natives.
This eliminates for the Nationalist
government the fear that the Eng-
lish, who sympathize with the
African natives, colored people and
Indians in their protest against
segregation, may raise the status
of the native and make him a real
factor with which the government
would have to contend.

Last January in opening the ses-
sions of the legislature, the Lieu-
tenant-Governor of the Union of
South Africa called for “apartheid”
(a stricter segregation of races)
in the only two “open” universi-
ties in South Africa, Cape Town
and Witwatersrand. The Student
Representative Councils of these
two universities and the National
Union of South African Students
turned to universities and colleges
all over the world asking for help
in opposing this policy.

It- is important to understand
that they are not asking us to sup-
port integration, but ask rather
that we protest the closing of the
only available facilities for educa-

‘|tion of the natives beyond twelfth

grade. Originally all nine of the
South African universities were
open to students of all races. Be-
cause of the “apartheid” policy,
the government has succeeded in
closing seven of these universities
to all but Eupropean students. No
“separate but equal facilities” are
being proposed. The government
desires to cut off all higher edu-
cation for the non-white, non-Euro-
pean population.

As students we should take an
active interest in the progress and
availability of education. We can
do something concrete. Petitions
are being circulated by the Na-
tional Student Association among
colleges and universities all over
the world, Join with thousands of
other students in protesting this
retrogressive measure. Do your
part as a student by taking the
opportunity to sign the protest
when it comes around to you.

Why, just yesterday I opened my

Reader Demands
Animal Coverage
Dear Editor:

There is a deplorable neglect in
your newspaper of the animal in-
trigue on campus. There have been
some notable developments of late.
Brandy, a dainty misanthropist be-
longing to one of our geologists, has
taken up with a scurvy low-brow
collie who carries her tail too far
over her back. The outcome of this
affair is dubious.

The LeBlanc’s aristocratic black
and white cat has caused consider-
able consternation by chasing a
shifty tabby through the windows
and under the beds only to dis-
appear for good over the roofs of
the Pembrokes. Let’s hope he
caught her.

The Borzoi remains aloof from
the rites of spring. She belongs to
the leisure class and _ probably.
wouldn’t mingle with the prole-

find her another Borzoi? , ia
These bestial affairs ought not
be neglected. You reflect campus
life you say. Let’s have complete
coverage.

Anti-Classicist Says
Long Live the Kelpy

Madame,

Regarding the Kelpie (i.e. Kel-
py). Despite a warm respect for
the solid Scott, of whom my great-
uncle Robert used to speak, I feel
that any sweeping discrediting of
the modern symbolizm and the del-
icate valance in internal half-rhyme
shown by

“Jaws dripping with

BLOOD and with GHOUL”
is to be deplored. Is our literary
viewpoint to be Hume-hewn and
thwarted. by the stodgy classicist?
This is the ultimate fringe of in-
finity. Who will step forward
from the ranks, the files and the
fretwork? Who will defend and/or
upend our radical-changing inde-
pendence in the era of bang and
blab?
Who indeed?

Beames Lost Faith
In Lost and Found

At present, Lost and Found is
about as defunct as an institution
can get around Bryn Mawr. Al-
though it is open for fifteen min-
utes five days a week (1:45 to
2:00), it is not infrequent that no
one comes, and during the past
week I have had only one customer.

Where this lack of interest comes
from I cannot deterniine, since
Lost and... Found...contains+- many
valuable articles, which I’m certain
their owners must want. Some of
them even have name tapes, but
although I’ve promptly sent notes
to the owners, many of them have
failed to appear. One case bothers _
me especially—I’ve had a heavy
winter coat for several months and
have sent the owner two notes, but
nothing has happened.

Of course, this disregard of
Lost and Found works both ways:
very seldom does any one bring me
a lost item they’ve found, and I
can only é¢ollect from the janitors
in the various buildings. With such
a complete oblivion surrounding it,
Lost and Found cannot be either
efficient or effective, and although
it would seem to be a necessary
institution, I would recommend
that it be abolished unless some
new interest is shown.

In case someone may be in total
ignorance, I will outline how Lost
and Found operates. It is located
in Taylor basement by the Bureau
of Recommendations, and although
it is only open from 1:45 to 2:00,
I’ve placed a list on the door so
that a student may come down at
any time and sign her name and @
description of the lost article. If

Clock-o-phile Gives
nies adie Message

Dear Bditor;

It recently came to my attention
that your school has been asked
to install and maintain a 150-year-
old grandfather’s clock in return

for a $100,000 bequest.

We had a grandfather’s clock
once. It was a lovely old piece,
a gift of the class of 1903. For
years the clock stood with quiet
dignity in the University library,
tolling away the hours with its
melodic chimes. Then, early this
year, the University opened a new
library. Books, shelves, students,
librarians, everything was moved
to the new building. Everything
except the clock.»

The main ‘room of the old library
was converted into a lecture hall-
auditorium. Maps, platforms, desks,

movie projectors, students, profs, _

and all gorts of assorted junk were
moved in. And in its corner, unno-
ticed, undusted, and forgotten,
stood the clock. No one even both-
ered to wind it.

Then I saw the Clock.

It looked so sad standing all
alone, stooped and humbled, listen-
ing to Geography 101 lectures, My
blood boiled; I was outraged. Im-
mediately, I wrote to Targum, our
school paper, and protested the
slighting of the Clock. I got no
results. I wrote again. This time
my letter was heeded. The follow-
ing day the Clock disappeared.

The next week was a hectic one.
Students all over the campus took
the cause of the Clock to heart.
Indignation reached fever pitch.
What had happened to our Clock?
The administration was troubled;
so they appealed to the Targum.
H. J. “Doc” Volz, the editor, tried
to quiet the mobs with an editor-
ial in which he stated the leader
of the Clock movement, me, did
not exist, ‘But this weak attempt
failed. My friends vehemently
confirmed my existence and the
students’ fever spread even faster.

Finally, the Clock was found.
The alumni house had taken the
Clock in, and had promised that
t would be properly wound, dust-
ed, and cared for. But the under-
graduates. had lost their Clock.

Accept your Clock, but treat it
well. Do not let our example go
for naught, (Grandfather’s Clocks
are sensitive. They have feelings
and they can be hurt.. Care for it.

Norman Stengler,

Its soul was deep and hollow
And everywhere the libr’y went

I’d rather see than be one.

Last week the Undergraduate
Association defined its position on
traditions with special reference to
Lantern Night. This definition was
a necessary step. In the past stud-
ents were allowed to refrain from
participation in college traditions,
but many were unaware of this
fact and felt compelled to —_
cipate.

One wonders what the repercus-

are two possible results: either
traditions will be supported more
strongly than in the past, or they
will disintegrate. They will be more
strongly supported because, if as
the Undergraduate Association as-
sumes, students are really interest-
ed in them, the disaffected will be
separated from the supporters. The
other possibility, that of disinteg-
ration, seems more likely, however.
Now that coercion had been dimish-
ed, even those mildly interested
people will be more apt to cease
taking part in them. The explan-
ation is that traditions like Lant-
ern Night which require weeks of
rehearsal lack spontaneity and
vitality. If certain traditions are no
longer enjoyable to most people,
then either they should be retained
for the few who will voluntarily |
take part in them, or they should

Religions this fall. The object of
these lectures will be to make us
at Bryn Mawr aware of the basic
differences in Eastern and Western
modes of thought, and to show us
how the religious. and cultural
values of the East may or may not
contribute to the spiritual develop-
ment of the West.

The first speaker will be Dr.

Schuyler Cammann, Professor of
Oriental Studies in the Graduate
School of Arts and Sciences at the
University of Pennsylvania. He will
accompany his talk on Buddhism
in the Art Lecture Room on Thurs-

As one freshman who. was quite
overcome by the traditions awaiting
her at Bryn Mawr, I welcomed your
excellent discussion of both sides
of the question, and should like to
let off some steam at this time.

I had the luck—good or bad—
of going to an American school in
Paris, the students of which came
from many different countries and
backgrounds. Some had never
undergone the process of a formal
education before; others came
straight from America; still others
were continentalized Americans. In
light of this smallness, and to
a certain extent location of the
school, traditions were difficult to
maintain. Not that they were
scorned; but with no football team,
no cheerleaders, no effective chor-
us, the thing known as school spirit
was virtually unknown. Instead, a
common affection for each other
and a bond: which being on an
American island in France created,
were to be found.

This may in part explain my
slowness to comprehend the tradi-
tions-fever.

Traditions, per se, are fine. But
all ‘too often they are notcarnfied out

‘with genuine love and’ respect but

rather out of a sense of compul-
sion. “Everyone is participating; I
cannot be’ different and do what

‘I feel like doing—else I shall surely

be ‘queer’.” Why? After all, Bryn
Mawr is supposed to be encourag-
ing individuality and to a certain
extent, non-conformism. Emerson
would be mildly surprised, to say
the least, at some of the very con-
formist trends in America—in Bryn ~~
Mawr, more specifically — today.

It is in-asking for special contributions from students

the administration expressed.

In any case, the student view taken is a deplorable one.
If the fears voiced had some basis, then perhaps the once
fashionable discusions on academic freedom should include
the liberty of the student as well as the professor’s. Second-
ly, to our knowledge, there has not been any tangible evidence
to support the incredible claims that Bryn Mawr possesses
a whimful “Big Brother” type administration. If such con-

Kraken Replaces

by Theo Stillwell

The kelpy is dead and drowned.
This is an age of manufacture,
(“a world of made is not a world of
born”) (e.e.c.) The new symbol
must be manufactured and mean-
ingless to all but the author. The
kraken, then, must take the place
of the kelpy. It has defied all at-
tempts to imbue it with a general
meaning, and it is, after all, only
a synonym for a rather prosaic
beast, the giant squid, which is
made from rubber, plastic and steel
and eats similar manufactured
creatures like Cap’t. Nemo,

The kraken has had a short, frag-
mentary and largely unnoticed lit-
erary history, In 1948 was written:

“. » you are mad,
You have taken a

kraken
For firm land of the past.”

There is here an unsuccessful at-
tempt to attach whale symbolism
to the kraken, since whales com-
monly slumber on the waters and
strongly resemble islands. (Hence
if you are claiming an island, first
light a fire on it to see’ what you
have actually got.) This identifi-
cation, of course, ends in madness.

The kraken is mentioned in
Moby Dick, but obviously could
never, unlike Gregory Peck, play

slumbering

Common Terminology Is Whale

Former Kelpu;

its limitations). Incidently, the
kraken is a good subject for poetry,
since no one knows anything much
about it, and you can have it do
virtually anything.

Tennyson did his best to found
a kraken cult, resembling the kelpy
worship carried on by Scott, but
he failed, and lamented the fact,
bitterly (“But O for the touch of a
vanished hand/And the sound of
a voice that is still”) (“Tears, idle
tears.”) The story of his attempt
will be found in his poem, “The
Kraken.” Tennyson was, in fact,
only one of several Victorians to
worship the sea (cf. Matthew Arn-
old; “A long, long sigh, For the
cold strange eyes of a .... Mer-
maid,” and Swinburne; “I will go
back to the great sweet mother...
the sea,” and Masefield, who car-
ries on the tradition; “I must down
to the sea again.”) “The Kraken”
has been assigned, with the rest,
to a sort of collective Victorian
womb complex.

So, for~anyone who wants to
write obscure, difficult and abstruse
poetry, the kraken may provide a
basis for a new mythology, since,
so far, all attempts to interest
people in him have failed, and it
is certain that those who will
understand. his nature, much less
his abortive literary, history, will

Dr. Bernheimer Discusses Representation
In Learned Philosophy Club Dissertation

Dr. Richard Bernheimer of the
History of Art Department spoke
on “Principles of Representation
before a meeting of the Philosophy
Club last Wednesday night. Dr.
Bernheimer who introduced him-
self as a “summer vacation philo-
sopher” gave a detailed discussion
on the difference between repre-
sentation and substitution.

Substitution is the replacement
of one entity by another, which is,
or serves as its equivalent. A rep-
sentatamen, besides standing for
something else, has an intrinsic
value of its own. Representatamen
can be subdivided into three -as-
cending classes which are: cate-
gorical, legal and mimetic. The
latter two are subdivided into an
active and “arrested” stage.

Substitution and representation
are most closely connected at the
categorical level: an example of
this level is the selection of one
apple to represent the whole class
of apples.

The second phase, legal repre-
sentation, can’t exist without sub-
stitution but a legal representa-
tion is not only or entirely a sub-
stitute for a person or people he
is representing. A Congressman,
for example, cannot xpress all
the views of each of the persons
he is representing. The rationale
of this phase is the awareness of
che person on the other side. This
example of the Congressman is
in instance of the “active phase”
of local representamen as it is
geared for the handling of concrete
issues. Besides this there is an
arrested phase which is character.
ised by its non-active, symbolic
aspect. An example of this is the

At Review of Exhibit
Dear Editor: °

We resent your reviewer’s filip-
pant attitude in her article on the
Picasso Exhibit. Aside from her
purely extraneous remarks, her
personal feelings about the at-
tractiveness of Picasso’s subjects
are irrelevant to the exhibition.

She says nothing definite about
any of the paintings except to re-
fer casually to the subjects as
lolling, vacant eyed, or composi-
tions of This or That, words which
do not adequately describe either
the actual representation or its
purpose. She says nothing that
differentiates Picasso from any
other artist.

Appropriateness is sacrificed to
cleverness. The Demoiselles d’
Avignon is indeed one of the earl-
ier cubist paintings, but the only
jumping the exhibition does is
from 1906 to 1907. The museum,
displays Guernica excellently; it
is foolish to consider its central
location only as an _ enticement.
Your reviewer evidently wishes
she could have beaten the Louvre

This is a letter of protest at the
use of living animals for the Fresh-
man Show. To say that it is un-
kind to the animal is putting it
mildly. At times—as in the casé
of this year’s horse—it verges on
cruelty. For twenty-four hours—
often longer—the animal must. be
kept in strange and usually un-
comfortable surroundings. The
horse “was “stabled” under the
porch at Yarrow—where wind and
snow could get at him—surrounded
by junk—old windows he might
have kicked and broken, cutting
himself in the process—old pieces
of wire and metal, and even an
ancient basketball hoop! We lis-
tened to his neighing in protest
all Saturday. (Where were the
sophomores’ ears?)

Granted that the snow and cold
were bad luck—but such things
should have been considered, as it
is not at all unusual to have weath-
er like this at this time of year.

Add to the hiding part, the fact
that most animals are thoroughly

frightened when faced with the
bright lights and screaming audi-
ence of Goodhart it seems to me
it all adds up to a picture of
thoughtlessnes and lack of consid-
eration for our fellow creatures.

Why not go back to the idea in
use some time ago of a mythical
or imaginary creature—represent-
ed by a model or a student in cos-
tume—in some way tied into the
plot of the show so it could be
brought on at the climax? This
would be just as much “fun” and
would not subject a live creature -
to the ordeal that is required by
the present system.

Is New Criticism
New: MacCaffrey

Continued from Page 1

Cleanth Brooks, in his book,
‘Understanding Poetry, has offered
the most satisfactory synthesis
Again, his
mission is to educate.

There have been many criticisms
of the “New Criticism,” the most
stressed of which is the way in
which these critics ignore history.
In other words ,they eliminate all
which is irrelevant, since it is the
reaction of the reader which
counts. However, this does not
mean that we can exclude the per-
iod in which the poem was written,
the poet’s life, etc. Some other .
comments have been that the
methods are not universally ap-
plicable, that they are one-sided,
and that the critics “murder to
dissect.” Some of the complaints
are less defendable, however; many
have been irritated by the state-
ment that poetry is complex; oth-
ers are merely upset that their
techniques, which they have been
using quietly for years, are now
being touted as being “new.”

Before closing, Mrs. MacCaffrey
gave a brief background of this
kind of literary criticism, which
actually began with Coleridge. In
his criticism“ of “Shakespeare, he
combined analysis with evaluation,
and came up with many interest-
ing comment on metaphors,

However, the problein for each
critic, be he new or not, is to
decide what is essential, and for



this he needs common sense, As

was one that no college such as
Bryn Mawr should have in its
weekly paper. It was not written
by an enlightened and unbiased
student, but it is an article that
could have been put together by
a bitter small-town editor from
material gathered from a series of
city editorials. It seems to me in-
credible that a student living in
such troubled times as ours should
not make an effort to understand
the conditions of other countries,
by. using her own mind to_ think
originally (instead of sitting back
and using other people’s well-worn
ideas), and: thereby ameliorating
the present prevailing conditions
of misunderstanding.

The whole editorial was based
on a pre-conceived notion:. Nasser
and his followers are grasping,
cunning, ferocious, and dictatorial.
I personally doubt very much
whether the writer of the article
had thought very deeply on the
validity of this concept., Besides,
are not all these terms relative?
What may seem cunning to one
party might be thought of as
shrewd to another party. No effort
was made by your editorial to
grasp the relativity in the problem
of the Egyptian situation. You
used such well-used phrases as
“ |. . we have a strong suspicion
that Nasser is better at surprise
attack than sustained, battle’ (a
suspicion I am sure you heard
someone’ else exclaim) and
“ ... it looks as if Nasser will be
this year’s coup-of-the-year-man.”
(Time Magazine?)

Here lies one of the most basic
problems of today’s world. Few
people are willing to put aside
their preconceived notions and
prejudices and make an effort to
understand another country’s char-
acter and necessities. Nasser is
often seen in the U. S. as a “sec-
ond Hitler” mainly because, taken
out_of context and placed into an
American frame of mind, the two
men seem to resemble one another.
But with a little thought and
effort one can find no basis of
comparison when one places the
two men into their respective
background and countries. The his-
tory and culture of Germany up
to the 19380’s is so far removed
and different to those of Egypt
that it is nearly impossible to
find a common ground on which to
base this so-called similarity. To
the American mind, democracy is
taken for granted as an essential
part of life, and anything less is
abhorrent and is a dictatorship. To
the Arab mind, however, democ-
racy has little or no meaning and
importance. It does not count at
all in the Arab’s system of values.
Consequently, it does not appear
fair when Americans speak of
Nasser’s “dictatorship” as a point
against him: They think too much
in their own terms, and make little
effort to understand the bewild-
ered Egyptians who have recently
been given a freedom which they
have not had for centuries, and
which they are not yet sure how
to use most correctly and advan-

Lehigh Sings With
BMC Sunday Eve

The chapel service Sunday eve-

the Lehigh University Glee Club.

Also appearing on the program
was the Lehigh Brass Ensemble,
a group of eight who played sev-
eral selections alone, and also ac-
companied the combined choruses
in the number In Excelsis.

The Bryn Mawr chorus | sang
Hans Leo Hassler’s Cantate Dom-
ino, and Kodaly’s Ave Maria. The
double octet gave from Bach’s
Jesu. Meine Freude Denn Das
Gesetz.

Among the numbers sung by the
Lehigh group were Bach’s Now
Let Every Tongue Adore Thee,
Handel’s O Magnum Mysterium
and Gerald Finzi’s Let Us Now
Praise Famous Men.

Mr. Hugh K. Wright, Jr,, the
director of the Main Line area
Student Christian Association gave
the invocation, the -benediction and
read several scripture passages.

A social hour for the two groups
followed in the Common Room.

“The Bryn ‘Mawr Chorus and
the Lehigh Glee Club get together
for ‘a concert every year,” said
Ellie Clymer, Chorus president.
“We always enjoy singing under

Student Desires Change

In Election Procedures
Dear Editor,

I am-at a loss to understand
why the, vice-presidents of League,
Alliance, and A.A. are elected by
the junior and sophomore classes
and the secretary of League and
Alliance by the sophomore class.
Even if it is felt that these offices
should be held by members of cer-
tain classes, it is not necessary
that they be elected by a class-
wide ballot.

League, Alliance and AA despite
“ipso facto” membership, are ad-
mittedly organizations of rather
specialized interests. That their
Presidents should be elected by a
college-wide vote is generally ac-
cepted, if for no other reason than
their place on College Council and
Undergrad Council, That all
Undergrad and Self-Gov positions
should be college or class elected
is also sensible for these organiza-
tions’ concern all students and do
not have boards in the same sense
that the other Big Four Organ-
ization do.

I do not doubt the importance
of the vice-president and the sec-
retary to their respective organ-
izations, but I do think that their
election should be in the hands of
the boards. Under the present sys-
tem, seniors and freshmen who are
vitally interested in an organiza-
tion have no voice in the selection
of these officers, while many peo-
ple who are not interested in the
organization and who have inade-
quate means of judging among the
candidates are practicaly pressur-
ed into voting. I am quite willing
either to delegate my vote for the
vice-presidents of these organiza-
tions to my hall .rep, or to attend
a board meeting if I am interested
in having a direct voice in the
election.

When the organizations concern-
ed reexamine their constitutions,
I hope they will carefully consider
the above suggestion. If the pre-
sent method is continued, the or-
ganizations should be required at
least to present suggested candi-
dates for these offices as they do
for the presidency.

Sincerely,
Natalie Naylor ’59

symbols about the main figure in

Goncalvez however is the embodi-

of religious paintings, present the
entire national character from
simple fishermen to high church-

In later paintings stemming

The many editorials on Bryn
Mawr apathy that have appeared
in the College News during the
past few years have had their
effect. These editorials, plus the
student body’s energetic dissatis-
faction with their own stagnant
self-satisfaction, has been the im-
petus for many a re-examination of
campus activities, and has found
its most recent success in the
Undergrad Conference on “Can
Democracy survive in America?”

The thanks of the whole student
body and of the many visitors
who were at Bryn Mawr on Satur-
day are owed to the ambitious or-
ganizers of this most successful
conference, and to the administra-
tion for its co-operation. Mr. Ros-

ivory tower, and letting in a re-

Dear Editor:

When has Bryn Mawr ever had
an inspiring and informative con-
ference as the one this past week-
end sponsored by the Undergrad-

ate that more Bryn Mawrtyrs did
not avail themselves of the op-
portunity to hear such great edu-
cators and scholars. Certainly
boredom is far off while we have
such men,

I hope that there will be many
more conferences like this one,
that it will become at least an an-
nual affair, although there has
been more thought, planning and
hard work put into it than any one
person can tell,

My congratulations and sincere
thanks to the Undergraduate

“Ambiguous Immortality” was
the title of the lecture given under
the auspices of the Philosophy
Club by Dr. Geddes MacGregor
last. Wednesday evening, May 7,
in the common room. In introduc-
ing his subject, Dr. MacGregor
said that there is ambiguity in the
term immortality and that there
are really three different theories
of immortality: the personal sur-
vival theory, the soul-substance
theory, and the eternal life theory.

The first of these theories carries
with it the idea of the survival of
the person or a pale resemblance
of the person such as a ghost or
shade. Many times this comes
from dreams in which a member
of a person’s family has appeared
to him. As an example of the per-
sonal survival theory, Dr. Mac-
Gregor cited the land of shades in,
Homer’s Odyssey.

The second of these theories, the
soul-substance theory, has as _ its
basis the soul as an eternal sub-
stance. In contrast to this, phys-
ical substances are “transitory in
character”, The body serves as’
environment for the soul. Accord-
ing to Dr. MacGregor, “this tre-
mendously influential theory pro-
vides for immortality as a pseudo-
scientific fact.” Because the soul
is an eternal substance, immortal-
ity is a part of the nature of man,
a “part of the very essence” of
man. Immortality, here, there-
fore, is something which need"

The placing by the Common-

Takes Issue With News

Last week I had the privilege to
be among a group of students (be-
tween nine and fourteen thous-
and students) which matched a
mile and a half through Washing-
ton to the Lincoln Memorial in
token of their belief that the schools
of America should be integrated, .
in hope that the presidept/ would
take a stronger stand on this cru-
cial issue than that which he has
heretofore taken, and in expression
of their conviction that no indi-



vidual should be discriminated ,
against because of\his race or re-
ligion,

I would like to take issue with
the editorial which appeared in the
College News of October 22nd. I
remain in some doubt as to the
stand the News takes, but-I get
the impression that you are for
integration, but against demonstra-
tions—in other words, you believe
the river should be crossed,. but
you are afraid to get your feet
wet.

I am surprised by your wide-eyed
assertion that the demonstration
would be “repugnant to nine out
of ten students here on campus”
and other brief glimpses you give
into the mind of the average Bryn
Mawr girl which leave one with a
rather damp picture of a spaghetti-
like, feminist cheerleader-turned-
sophisticate,; whose sensitive soul
“shinks instinctively” from the |
thought of, any digression from a
vague code, called a “fetish for
decorum”,

I cannot believe that you would
or could make these assumptions
and assertions if you fully under-
stood the demonstrations that took
place in ‘Washington, D.C, on Oc-
tober 25. Therefore, I am going
to try to clear up some misconcep-
tions that you seem to have.

In the first place, the march was
most emphatically NOT (as you
term it) a “purposeful creation of
disturbance”, nor was it (as you
insinuate), an emulation or a con-
donement of mass protests in the
south’ on the part of “incensed
It was a quiet, dig-
nified, and solemn procession of
students from colleges (among
them Harvard, Yale and Swarth-
more), church groups, and some
children accompanied by adults.
It was carefully planned and
smoothly executed; the tone was.
one of hope, not bitterness; the
motive was positive (appeal), not
negative (protest). It took as its
model, not the incensed southern
rei ont Rinhorts marchers for

Carolyn Kern’s spirited account
of “Bryn Mawr in the ’20’s” (Col-
lege News, November 5, 1958)
prompts me to offer my reminis-
Jeences of how the Self-Govern-
ment smoking rules were changed.
However, I did not, as has been
implied, champion retention of the
old restrictions when the Self-Gvo-

‘ternment Association met to dis-

cuss them the fall of my junior
year. Rather, I urged their dras-
tic revision. Despite stage fright
(it was my first public speech), I
attacked the rules as undesirable
and unenforceable, and - provoking
a “crime wave on campus” because
they were being violated on the
sly. Later, I served on the com-
mittee elected to remodel the whole
Self-Government structure.

The truly heroic roles in this
affair, however, belonged first to
President Marion Edwards Park
who presented the students’ rec-
ommendations to the Board of Di-
rectors, and secondly to the Di-
rectors who accepted them. For
no matter whether they may priv-
ately have deplored smoking by
young women as an exhibition of
bad taste, they publicly champion-
ed the moral right of the students
to decide such an issue for them-
selves. Of course, we had no ink-
ling of what this stand would
mean, although Miss Park and the
Directors must have known. For
the President’s announcement that
smoking was permitted on campus
made front page news from coast
to coast, and while the New York
Times praised her stand, many oth-
er sheets heaped vilification on
her and on the College. A west
coast college paper, I remember,
stigmatized our smoking as. “a
gesture of the brothel.”

a liberal of the great tradition cher-
ishing personal freedom and hum-
an dignity with deep conviction and
moral fortitude. She has never
shirked a duty because it was un-
pleasant nor, when the call came,
been afraid .to stand up and be
counted, Behind her and behind ath
of us, defenders of our liberties,
have always stood the Board of Di-
rectors of the College.

Since I was one of the crowd

with interest the report of the
lecture in the College News. This
report puzzles and even more dis-

concern for the state of philosophy
at Bryn Mawr and for its repute
abroad. I am puzzled because it~
is only the first. part of the lecture
—the witty and erudite sketch of

chaotic contemporary state—that
is reported at all. The latter, and
philosophically significant, part of
the lecture is simply ignored. A
reader, of the College News who
had not heard the lecture might
well suppose that Professor Fer-
rater Mora was treating his audi-

Interfaith Defines
Religious Groups’
Role On Campus

by Helen Ullrich

Several active off-campus religi-
ous groups are now working in co-
ordination with the Interfaith As-
sociation, These clubs include : the
Catholic Discussion Group, the
Student Christian Movement, and
Connections
with Jewish groups for social pur-
poses are being arranged.

These groups will be using col-
lege communications and facilities.
Anyone with interest is encouraged
to join the group in-+which she
professes interest, Watch the In-
terfaith bulletin board for news of
what these clubs are doing.

Catholic Discussion Group

The Catholic Discussion Group
consists of those girls interested in
learning more about Roman Cath-
olicism. This group has a Jesuit
priest from St. Joseph’s College,
Father Ehrhardt, to lecture and
lead these discussions. Lou McCrea
is the chairman with Becky Tin-
gle, secretary, and Janine Gilbert,
social chairman, assisting. This
club has no extra-campus affilia-
tions such as the Newman Club.
Meetings are held at 11:00 on Sun-
days at the Duffy’s home located
across from the Church of the Re-

deemer.

This semester the Trinity was
the topic for discussion. The
members of the Catholic Discus-
sion Group decided that meetings
should be held every Sunday dur-
ing the series (5 weeks) instead
of being held every fortnight. Fu-
ture plans involve a series on mor-
al theology with guest speakers.
The officers hope that Miss Logras-
so will speak on Dante and on St.
Francis. A question session is
also planned for non-Catholics and
Catholics: who wish to challenge
the basic tenets of the Church.

‘Between the morith’ of January
and May, Bryn Mawr’ professors
will have traveled approximately
2700 miles spreading learning from
Kalamazoo to ‘Atlantic City ° on

| topics~ranging from “college en- |

trance through the metabolism of
mice,

The busiest of the peregrinating
professors: will be Miss Lehr who,
as a lecturer for the Mathematical

Association of America, will leave:

March 15 for a tour of Ohio, Michi-
gan, Minnesota, and; Iowa where
she will speak at ten different col-
leges and universities. On April
1st, her talk, “On the Eve of Space
Travel—Kepler, 1609,” at Carlton
College in Minnesota will be tele-
vised as a feature of the Minne-
sota Private College Hour.

Speaking at an Atlantic City
meeting of the Eastern Psychologi-
cal Association on April 8rd- 4th
will be both Dr..Bitterman and Dr.
Brown. Dr. Bitterman will deliver
his paper, “Toward a Comparative
Psychology of Learning: Some Ex-
periments with Fish and Other
Animals,” while Dr. Brown will
speak on “Personality and Ideal
Performance in College.”

Dr. Brown’s report, the result of
his work done as a Research Fellow
of the Mellon Fund, will be deliv-
ered again on May 28rd at the Uni-



ginners. Have faith in their enor-
mous good will, even if you permit
yourself to doubt their good judg-
ment sometimes.

Startling Style?

Q. Does one have to use some
startling style or appeal to some
established vogue to succeed? NO
NO NO NO. Again, look at your
correspondent! Who could be less
beat? Naturally I think it helps
to have a subject which has an ob-

your. own, and the feeling for the
subject must be your own: itis
death to chances of success, let
alone to proper self-development
as a writer, to try for vogues. A
generation ago, good writers miss-
ed their chance by pattering after
Hemingway. This chase ends in
one place: Monkey Hill. You may
sell a story or a book—many have
—hbut it just won’t be much of a
start in life.

Gives Advice to Youth

(You didn’t ask me this one, but
I’m pretending you did). What’s
my pet advice for the young?
Don’t hang around with other
young people too much, Hang
around older people! Listen to
what the old girls and buzzards
say in class. Read the books.
Make some friends outside your
generation. Look at grown-ups.
Listen to grown-ups. Youth is
something we are put into this
‘world to rise above, to paraphrase
a celebrated thought. It is some-
thing not to be exploited—it is
something to be outgrown as RAP-
IDLY as possible. It is better to
hang around with people a lot
younger than yourself—10, 14, etc.
—than with people in your own
age group. You all arrest each
other’s development. — si

One more thing: if you’re writ-
ing something; ask yourself all the
time, not is this ME, or is this
truly sensitive, or well expressed
or anything—just ask yourself, is
it interesting. All the time, is it
interesting—get your friends, pref-
erably older ones of course, to
read your ms, and write just two
words in the margin at all appro-
priate spots—‘“interesting” and
“dull.” These are key words I
think. If quite a few people think
something you have written is in-

To the Editor:

Each year as spring approaches,
horrid little green patches begin to
grow up all over campus. Some-
thing ought to be done about this!
It is rather disturbing to think that
soon all jthe gittd, clean, fresh,
brown dirt will be completely cov-
ered with this green stuff if im-
mediate action is not taken.

It seems that as the weather be-
comes warmer, students and facul-
ty, who have been. walking across
the lawns all winter, completely
change character and become “side-
walk walkers.” This antipathetic
attitude is no help to those who are
charged with keeping the campus
clean and neat. Bryn Mawr has a
lovely campus, but everyone’s’ co-
operation is needed to keep it that
way.

I propose a springtime campaign!
Try not to walk on the sidewalks.
If everyone takes part in walking
across the lawns, we moy be able to
win the battle against the green
weeds. And, for the more enthusi-
astic group, it might be fun to see
how many green patches you can
pull out of the ground in the next
few .weeks,

The teacher and the student at
Bryn Mawr should be ashamed of
their relationship. It is wanting.
A freshman entering this college
is usmally overwhelmed by the im-
personality and laissez-faire atti-
tude which the faculty seems to
have for the student, She seldom
sees the professor outside the
classroom, other than in a “paper”
conference, or the traditional cof-
fee hours, which few professors
attend. And, it is generally the
recently-arrived professors who
make it a point of suggesting,
“(Come to my office if you have a
problem.” When the student does
meet a professor in his office, she
usually returns to her friends smil-
ing and exclaims, “Why, he’s a real
person—I never would ‘have be-
lieved it.”

Although a popular national
magazine has accredited Bryn
Mawr with being the ~ ” wom-
en’s college in the country, this is
no. reason that we who attend it
should consider ourselves better
than our friends who attend Smith
or Goucher. Our minds need just
as much guidance as theirs, I am
increasingly surprised at the num-
ber of students on this campus
who do not really know why or
what they are doing here—or even
how to go about finding out. One

Bachrach Interview Evokes Student Response: Seniors Take Pro and Con

Bachrach’s Theories Questioned

by Mary Ann Robbins *

Before. discussing. Mr, Bach-
rach’s ideas on teaching, I think
it only ‘fair to establish a few
facts. First, I am involved in that
static field of “dead languages”:
the classics. Secondly, I am not
at all sure I understand what he
is saying, and if I do, that his
ideas are so startling. This “sense
of commitment and skepticism”
need to be defined. Does he mean
that commitment” is social or in-
tellectual? In Latin, “commito”
means to “cause to come togeth-
er.’ Is “commitment” here a

special “igeneral’ term applicable

only to. social. science, or does
Mr, Bachrach mean it as the men-
tal result of “sending together
certain forces”?

I’ may be wrong, but I would

deduce that, according to Mr.
Bacharch, training equals “com-
mitment and skepticism.” From

the point of view of my field, this
equation is incomplete; it should
read: X plus training plus ego equals
a disciplined understanding. X
is a corpus of facts ‘which we as-
sume to be true (after, all you
must accept something as. true).
In Latin, the facts are a series of
texts which are accepted as. au-
thentic. First we. must .Jearn the
language and how ito read. We.
then apply this training to the
text. A series of evolutions takes
place in which training plus text
plus personal reaction come into
play and from which a disciplined
understanding emerges. We may
repeat this process innumerable
times and each time the ego is
different, thereby influencing the
outcome.

Of course, some subjects of
study do not immediately appeal
to or excite some people. How-
ever, I don’t think that immediate
“enthusiasm is a guide to what is
affecting a student. We cannot

; material may not become import-

ant, The weekly grind of fresh-
man comps does not arouse much
enthusiasm, but, as many upper
classmen know, the discipline was
invaluable, Here, it is the process,
not the end product which was
“significant.”

‘Mr. Bachrach twice uses the
term “within a theoretical frame-
work” in connection with analy-
sis. ‘What is this farmework, the
method, the subject, or the prob-
lem? which aspect of the frame-
work is theoretical: the method,
the subject or the problem? The
criterium of a subject seems to be
that the student finds it “intellec-
tually significant.” Again, Mr.
Bachrach should define his terms:
Does the student recognize that
an idea or 'what-have-you is sig-
nificant in the field of study or to
the student himself?

I had supposed that, at least in
my field, undergraduate study in-
cludes ‘covering the broad aspects
of a field, to lay the basis for spec-
ialized study later. The student
body comes from such varied ex-
perience and educations that it
seems necssary to give them some
common knowledge, at least in the
first year courses. Again, perhaps
the nature of political science does
not presuppose such information.

‘Within my department, the only
one which I know, there is no ev-
dence of a hidebound ipolciy against
change. No course covers the
same material any year, and, I
imagine, no professor teaches the
same subject matter with the ex-
act same emphasis each time he
teaches it, I also wonder whether
Mr, Bachrach has ever sat in on
a curriculum committee. meeting.
What are these “so-called imper-
sonal forces” which cause institu-
tional change. They must refer
to a terminology iparticular to the
social sciences. I invite Mr.
Bachrach to define his terms and



be sure that ata later date the

discuss. them. further.

Highlights

Soph Carnival Activities

by Alison Baker

“La Swim Fantastique” proved
itself one of ‘the highlights. of the
Sophomore Carnival. To. review it
in the spirit of the event requires
not only’ enthusiasm, ,of which I
have plenty, but also a myriad of
other. energies, skills and. virtues.

In their entirely original aqua-
ography, the officers of the group,
advised by Miss Yeager, comple-
mented a lively and. diversified se-
lection of music with excellent ideas
of characterization and visual pat-
terning.

The performance of these num-
bers by the Bryn Marines made the
difficult look simple and the almost
impossible only lsightly trouble-
some. > :

What’ smore, they stayed togeth
some, ‘What’s more, they stayed
together ‘practically all the time,
with each other and with the mu-
sic. In short, it was not only a
fantastique swim, but also @ syn-
chronized one and full of spirit.

Show Begins

The show started off with a bevy
of red and white costumed swim-
mers in a floating routine: “To a
Wild Rose.” With apparently effort-
less flat-backed floating, they drifted
together in a kaleidescope of pat-

» terns devised by. Charlotte Pretty.

It is true the rose had an occasional
petal out of place, but the general
effect was-very decorative. ..
Dayle Benson, who next appeared
as a solo “Pinocchio,” was much the
most expert of the swimmers, and

very imaginative in arranging her|*~

routine to the tune of “Pop Goes
the Weasel.” Even under water she
managed -somethow to stay with

complicated series of stunts with
‘perfect precision and timing.
“Red Shoes” was to my mind the
most successful of the.large group
numbers, for which praise is due
to Penny Morgan, its aqua-ogra-
pher. She co-ordinated a wide vari-
ety of stunts so that there were
no perceptible lapses of interest
and closed with a spectacular linked
back dolphin. The performance and
costuming, too, were very successful
“Toy Soldiers on Parade” was
somewhat repetitive, particularly
after most of the standard stunts
had been exploited in earlier num-
bers, but enjoyably aqua-ographed
by Julie Lathrop-and well executed.

Solo Numbers

“Serenade of the Pagodines,” an-
other solo planned and swum by
Dayle Benson, concentrated on its
orientalism and hand movement. It
was not as spectacular as “Pinoc-
chio,” but the swimming was very
polished and fitted the lyricism of
the music.

Next came the “Three Little Kit-
tens,” a very pert trio. With actually
rather little stunt material, Char-
lotte Pretty composed a routine
which made effective use of a
few very simple gestures, such
as the flip of a-paw coyly splashing
‘water to the side. The performers
were full of spirit. The finale was
a complex number illustrating the
story and music of “Snow White
and the Seven Dwarfs.” All the
swimmers exhibited not only excel-
Jent swimming but also good char-

acterization.

The editorial in the April 22
issue of The College News present- |
ed both an accurate and startling
picture of the decided lack of re-
ligion courses in the curriculum.
In writing this, I am not attempt-
ing to reiterate what has already
ben said but to add what I can
concerning the need for and in-
terest in an expanded religion de-
partment here at Bryn Mawr.

Contrary to what may be popu-
larly believed concerning religion
on college campuses today, there
appeans to. be some. génuine inter-
est in the subject here, especially
from an intellectual point of view.
In order to become aware of this
fact, one has only to note the num-
ber of off-campus organizations
that have arisen in response to
those religious needs of Bryn
Mawr students which are not met
by the college community. The
Jewish girls are invited to attend
meetings and services at Swarth-
more while some of the Roman
Catholic students have a regular
discussion group. The Young
Friends also offer a variety of ac-
tivities. The (Student Christian
Movement has a weekly speaker
and discussion period attended fre-
quently by as many as fifty peo-
ple. Furthermore, it has offered
four well supported study groups
this year: one on the relation of
religion to social problems, one
eoncerning religion in modern lit-
erature, and two divisions on
Protestant theology.

Does the fact that so many stu-
dents seek religious education
outside the campus give one the
picture of a college that is meeting
the religious interests of its stu-
dents adequately? I think not.

INo doubt many more than those
directly connected with these or-
ganizations are interested in the
field of religion but do not wish
to become associated with a par-
ticular group. The Interfaith As-
sociation has presented a number
of programs to foster and sustain
religious growth on campus but it
is limited in many ways. The col-
lege itself in failing to provide
aedquate courses in this field is
either discouraging what interest
there may be or contributing to
uninformed beliefs: In the near
future I hope that there will be
some serious consideration of this
problem by the administration.

Sincerely yours,
Barbara Broome 60

We ought to ask why there is
little faculty-student relationship.
The state of the intellectual atmos-
phere at Bryn Mawr explains and
in my opinion justifies this distant
relationship. The main fault lies
not in the faculty but in the stu-
dents. The faculty does ask ques-
tions in class but the students are
apathetic, Either they didn’t do
the reading or they haven’t listen-
ed closely enough to the lecture,

Their questions for the most
part are not intelligent. Some-
times they ask questions merely
to ask questions. The faculty-stu-
dent relationship will be closer
and only deserves to be closer for
those students who have some-
thing important and worthwhile to
contribute in a discussion with the
faculty. Why take up the valu-
able time of a professor merely
to know him better. socially?

In the course of a worthywhile
conversation the professor’s per-
sonality will be revealed anyway.

To the Campus:

For the last two years, I have
been the NSA Co-ordinator here
at Bryn Mawr, a position very
few people know exists. Nor do
they know for what NSA stands.

The National Student. Associa-
tion was formed twelve years ago
to unite American students into a
body which could give direction to
student opinion at home and
abroad. It was the third attempt
at such an organization and has
been very successful.

Two years ago, NSA took a
stand on the apartheid policy in
universities of the government of
the Union of South Africa. As a
single body, hundreds of college
camipuses protested the closing of
schools to colored students. They
succeeded at the lesat, in persuad-
ing the officials to put off action
for a year.

During. the Hungarian revolt,
NSA ‘was instrumental in placing
Hungarian students in American
colleges, ‘

needs, Our own election system
was suggested by NSA. As a
member school, we have access to

Piano Cello Dialogue

Beethoven’s A major sonata
(Op. 69) opens with a lush dia-.
logue between piano and cello, in
which the two musicians demon-
strated to what perfect accord
they had worked out their inter-
pretation of the music. This sen-
sitive correspondence of phrasing
and character in the music was
typical of the entire performance
and one of the features which most
contributed to its excellence. It
is particularly remarkable in view
of the fact that Miss Eto replaced
Ruth Meckler, the original accom-
panist, on very short notice.

Dynamism Evolves

Both piano and cello brought out
the tremendous dynamism and
contrasting quiet dignity of the
Beethoven sonata, a variety found
within individual movements as well
as in their, uxtaposition. This in-

sity of bowing techniques, a large
and subtly graded range of dy-

Parents Hear Talk
By Mrs, Marshall

‘Addressing a parental assem-
blage half-filling Goodhart Hall and
comprising ‘‘the most impressive
audience since ‘I’. S. Eliot and e. e
cummings,” Mrs.. Marshall spoke
Saturday morning about “one’s
daughter at Bryn Mawr” —her
campus life and’academic attitudes.

“Her college career,” she said,
“begins ,the spring before she ar-
rives, with admissions. ... We look
for students who we feel will bene-
fit most from a Bryn Mawr educa-
tion . . ., the academic record is
the primary consideration — the
work expected at Bryn Mawr is
difficult and can be almost painful
for the student without motivation.

. The student must-also be one
who. can take responsibility in a
self-governing community.

“it is on the assumption that the
students here are responsible—and
mature—that our system of coun-
seling is based.... We want students
to have freedom—even freedom in
making mistakes! We try to let
them make their own plans and
arrange their. own schedules. ;~..
There are many people ready to
help, but it is the student who must
take the initiative.

“In everything we do we try to
respect the students’ individuality
and privacy. Students are’ never
discussed in conferences and. our
records of individuals’ progresses
are very small—small enough to
have astounded last year’s evaluat-
ing committee.

“Students at Bryn Mawr have
been ready to accept responsibility
_ —not only for themselves, but for
the student college community. The
faculty has authority only over
matters academic—there is no ad-
ministration censorship or veto over
any campus activities or roganiza-
tions. The Self-Government Associ-
ation reviews infractions of rules
and decides upon discipline—there
is no instance in the college’s 75
years that the administration has
not accepted its recommendation.

“It is the academic side of Bryn
Mawr that is, however, the most
important. It is based,’”’ Mrs. Mar-
shall said, “on the belief that a
sound education must provide a
general liberal arts background
combined with training in depth

a student can reach an advanced

Humanities Profs
Look Toward East

~The Humanities and Social Sci-
ences faculty discussion had a
capacity audience of interested par-
ents on Saturday afternoon. Mr.
Ferrater Mora moderated the panel
made up of Miss Mellink, YT.

Kennedy.

In introducing the first speaker,
Mr. Ferrater Mora emphasized that
“there can be no. understanding of
the present without an understand-
ing of the past.” Mr. Broughton of
the Latin department then discussed
a new point of view toward the
study of the history of classical
Greece and Rome. “Can old knowl-
edge be useful—as new wine in old
bottles?” Mr. Broughton went on
to say that a better metaphor would
be new bottles for a fine old wine.
Two reasons.for the value of an-
cient history today are new discov-
eries and new perspectives. The
Hittite tablets of the Near East,
the Mycean tablets that establish
a civilization back to 1400 B.C., and
the Dead Sea Scrolls are examples
of discoveries that have changed
interpretations of the ancient world.
The impartiality of the searcher
opens new doors of interpretation
and application of ancient history.

“Archaeologists are producing
embarrassing discoveries,” began
Miss Mellink. Their discoveries
make life difficult not only for the
historian but for students of art,
architecture, and philology. Archae-
ology has usually been limited to
so-called classical studies of the
civiliations of Greece and. Rome.
Only recently has the ancient world
been proven strongly indebted to
the Near East, and near eastern
archaeology offers a still new and
unexplored field.

According to Mr. Harper, a true
cultural anthropologist customarily
works with a primitive society be-
cause of its simplicity and uniform-
ity of culture. His technique is
usually participant observation. The
reasons for the anthropological
method of going from the less to
the more complex is the principle
that “knowledge should be about
all men.” An anthropologist’s ques-
tion is “what can we study in. this
mass of culture?” Certain general-

Talks About Temperament, Government

“T dare to tell the truth about
Franco-Spain.” This is how Andrés
Revész introduced the substance of
his lecture to the Spanish Club on
Thursday night. Spain, he main-
tained, is not a totalitarian, but an
authoritarian state.

Every revolution or counter-
revolution considers itself the sole
depository of the truth. Every
Spaniard considers himself the only
defender of the truth. Hence, his
temperament ig anarchical and
must be controlled, which is why
a democratic system in the true
sense of the word would not work
in Spain. Democracy is an idea, not
a governmental system. A free gov-
ernment or press does not matter
to the Spaniard if he can have per-
sonal freedom.

’ The personality of the Spaniard
is passionate and romantic. He
hates and loves intensely because
he cannot understand .arbitration.
To him honor is more important
than wealth. He has to be “Caesar
or no one.” “If a Spaniard is Catho-
lic he is more so than the Pope. If
he is a Communist, he considers the
Russians merely bourgeois.” -

The Spanish are a very austere
people. They do not need even what
we consider the necessities of life.
For this reason Mr. Revész says}.

an invaluable contribution to any
future war. However, they do not
want war. This is why they accept
Franco: as an alternative to civil

L.

war. Even those who most oppose
Franco are afraid of the ‘future
without his prestige, which is hold-
ing the country together. By law,
a man must be 30 before he can
be king of Spain. This gives Franco
9 years before Don Carlos is of
age. It is hoped that by this time
Don Carlos will be better known
to the people, since the Spanish
are afraid of a unknown without
Franco.

time, how it feels to be a scientist.
They also agreed that a major is

important because it allows the
student to delve deeply into one
field, stimulating her interest suffi-
ciently so that she may desire to
do the same in other fields. Mr.
Berliner acted as Moderator.

Mr. Michels explained the prob-
lems of teaching science in general,
and physics in particular, at Bryn
Mawr. Its extensive graduate pro-
gram in comparison to its size
means that its faculty of eighty
members is involved directly with
all levels of graduate and under-
graduate work, as well as with

individual. research. projects. This, |

combined with the fact that Bryn
Mawr is.a liberal arts school, forces
the faculty to be non-specialist and
encourages them to take more con-
sideration of the relationship be-
tween undergraduates _ gradu-
ates.

In science, this relationship be-
tween advanced and basic: work is
more difficult to agree upon than it.
is in other fields. Here the faculty
are working on the frontiers while
their teaching is, of necessity, in-
volved with already established ma-
terial. It is impossible to bring the
students up to the frontier as they
do not have the background; at the
same time, however, the teacher
must guard against the temptation
of staying completely within the
realm of established fact and thus
giving the student a false impres-
sion, At present, the Physics Depart-
ment’s 101 course contains a great
deal of classical mechanics as well as
examination of present-day events
in light of these classical theories.

Biology, stated Mr. Berry, is a
wide field;“‘ There are many ‘ologys’
in Biology.” The problem of organ-
izing the curriculum is therefore
probably more acute for it than for
any other science because there is
so much more that can be included.

There was then some discussion
among the panel members’ regard-
ing the new method of teaching the
101 course. Miss Oppenheimer pro-

does not have the time to get to
know the students and:their prob-
lems. Mr. Conner agreed with her,
but pointed out that -the student
did get the opportunity to see the
subject from different points of
view, as a result of having several
different instructors throughout the
year.

Members of the student body and
their parents also had an opportun-
ity to speak. Their major ‘concern
was survey courses. One of ithe stu-
dents felt that the present ‘101 sci-
ence courses are sometimes too
technical and difficult for a non-
science student and that there
should be seperate division of these:
courses, one for science students,
the other for non-science students.

One of the parents, then ad-
vocated survey courses for a
slightly differen treason. He felt that
a student majoring in one field|
usually has the time to take only
the one required course in a field
outside her major. Without-survey
courses, therefore, the student gains
only a very specialized knowledge
of that subject. —

I’m much interested in the cur-
rent News discussion and sorry
that a long-standing engagement
at the University Museum pre-

vents my coming to the “panel.

Here are a few ideas:

Advice—I think plenty of it
swills round but it’s not always
followed without tergiversations
involving a lot of wasted breath.
A longer pause with calendar and
conscience not to mention common
sense before seeking advice might
help.

Personal and intellectual devel-
opment—jWhy should the faculty
discuss your personal develop-
ment? this seems to me egotism
rum mad. You are here at some
cost to parents and scholarship
funds to get basic college educa-
tion. iif you want mental, person-
al advice there are faretts, priests
and doctors to give or sell it.

Classroom—the classroom could
reveal a great deal more if all
persons in it assumed responsibil-
ity. Faculty may be driven to lec-
ture the anxious for discussion
because students sit back and don’t
open their mouths even when ask-
ed to. This is a two-way busi-
mess. Some faculty are better than
others at extracting comments
‘but even the best can do little
with gals who refuse to make any
effort at. all to be articulate,

Tm glad education here is a
surprise even if not always pleas-
ant.

Koad Faculty research com-
n which their liveli-



student body. Intellectual devel-
opment should come partially
from classroom and lab, partially
from library, partially from each
other in dorm and common room.
This depends on the student fash-
ion. At the moment this is I think
more concerned to Bludgeon the
nearest male into matrimony than
in discussing integration, the UN
or new directions in scholarship.
It might change. Certainly the
News and other organizations are
doing a grand job of rousing the
rabble. But the faculty is pretty
much powerless here outside of a
willingness to see any student
that asks to see and talk and out-
side of an interest (which this let-
ter should show) in everything
going on. But this interest is a
part only of my life—I’ve a hus-
band, a township, parents,.a gar-
den, a book and some learned soci-
eties as well as amateur theatri-
cals and student debating socie-
ties on campus. These have been
part of my life ever since I’ve been
here. I like students and enjoy
meeting them but I don’t believe
I can do anything whatever to
stimulate the independent intellec-
tual interest of the student out-
side the class. College is most
valuable often because of the
friends you make and the ideas
you exchange. But if these ideas |
and friendships could include the
intellectual—the college would be
much more of an educational ex-
@erience to the students and the
faculty than it apparently now is."

I believe that it is not known to many people
either on or off campus that “Undergrad” has
cause to celebrate a significant anniversary of its
own this year.

It is the tenth anniversary of its uniquely gen-
erous program of sponsoring a student of foreign
citizenship at Bryn Mawr. This plan took shape
after the war and the first few students who en-
joyed this privilege were refugees, expellees, “dis-
placed persons” as they were called, whose educa-
tions had been cruelly interrupted and who had no
opportunity to continue their studies anywhere, no
matter how talented and ambitious they were. More
recent holders of this scholarship have been prom-
ising overseas students who were determined to
study at Bryn Mawr, but could not have attended
and American institution without scholarship help.

I know of no other college or university at
which a student organization or the whole under-
graduate student body holds itself responsible for
the total cost of a fellow student from one to four
years, depending on the circumstances. Some stu-
dents, for example, could be given sophomore or
junior standing.

On some campuses a foreign student who has
been given a tuition scholarship by the institution is.
invited to live in a sorority or fraternity house
without cost. At others the students contribute to a

so dedicated to beauty and truth
as Frank Lloyd Wright would: de-

other than a place to view art: in
a way that would enhance the

hearing the many dissenting com-

would see and how I would feel
when going into the new“Solomon

I bring Dramamine?) Since my
visits last Friday afternoon and
Saturday morning I feel very
strongly that the new museum is a
statement of faith for both non-
objective art and for museums to
house such works.

Contemporary art is different in
purpose from other art ... and
must be recognized as such to be
understood and appreciated. The
Guggenheim Museum is construct-
ed in a way to display the paint-

advantage. Frank Lloyd Wright
conceived of this new way to dis-
play art ... a continuous progres-
sion along spiral ramps, punctuat-
ed by partitions. There is not. a
maze of rooms to confuse, nor dark
corners to conceal.

That there are no frames and
that many paintings are in sus-
pension from the wall is to their
advantage. Here, at last, is a
building designed to display art
that was created to be in a gal-
lery. These works of art were not,
as most used to be, painted for
definite punposes such as churches,
individuals, and organizations, and
later collected and placed in rooms
of a museum. Frank Lloyd Wright.
has recognized this difference and
has created a building that can

My own sensations at being
within the building were ones of
involvement and integration with
the structure. I took the elevator
to the top and walked down the
ramp, noting that the placement
and lighting of the paintings en-
hanced them. The slant of the
ramp was not sufficient to make
me uneasy that the paintings were

Students of Bryn Mawr College, an opportunity
and an obligation to prove that we are worthy of
running our own government now confronts us.
Within the next few weeks, we must prevent any
change in the walking rules.

The rules are being re-examined because they
have lbeen broken. ‘The indifference of a few stu-
dents toward their own safety now threatens the
safety of the entire campus, for many people find
infringement of rules justification for change.

Certainly, infringement justifies reconsidera-
tion, for it is possible that broken rules are faulty.
The present rules states that girls must walk in
groups of three or more after dark when wandering
on campus or walknig off campus away from the
Ville. The number three was selected because it
seemed the minimum amount to assure safety. Be-
cause girls have found three people inconvenient to

procure and a hindrance to personal conversation, —

they have broken this rule. But no one has sudden-
ly proven that three is superfluous and two sufficient
for safety. Proper lighting, the answer to the prob-
lem, has not yet been installed. Therefore, recon-
sideration of the rule should cease at this point,
for the rule is not faulty and three girls are still
needed to assure safety.

But the Advisory and Executive Boards have not

dropped the matter... Through fear of their ability
to enforce the rule in the face of many infringe-
ments and of the subsequent ineffectiveness of Self-
Gov, they have decided to submit the matter to our
campus.

‘Now it is up to us to elect the right alternative.
Although four choices are offered, only retention of
the present rule cam be accepted. Many of the stu-
dents claim that such a matter as walking after dark
should be left to the discrtion of the individual.
After all, are not the sudents of Bryn Mawr intelli-
gent enough to look after their own safety? These
students do not realize that their egoistic attitude
toward their own independence is prompting such
an opinion. The sudents of Bryn Mawr are also
intelligent enough to read, but would we leave guns
around with the sign, “Loaded Guns, Do Not Touch,”
and trust the discretion of the individual ?

No! We must assume responsibility for those
of our classmates who do not care about their own
safety. Any of us who vote to make the rules more
lenient may pay for our action with the life or
welfare of a friend. (Millions of dollars are spent
to save people trapped in caves. How much cheap-
er is one slightly inconvenient rule to save our
classmates,

Fellow students, now more than ever must we
show that the freedom to choose our own rules will
not result in anarchy, (Let us have the maturity to
refuse absolute freedom when it beckons. The
strength of democracy rests in the ability of citi-
zens to govern themselves, not to destroy govern-
ment. We must accept our ir responsibility and retain
the present rule. -—-

so I. admire you for having had the strength of
conviction to do so. Similarly I have never tried to
answer such a letter so please bear with me in my
first attempt.

Let me begin by saying that while you have
presented well your opinion on the walking rule
and the implications which its revision could have
for Self-Gov in general, I feel that you have sadly
underrated the sincerity and intelligence of those
who hold opinions differing from yours, There are
several points to whichI would like to make specific
reference. re

First of all, the straw ballot presented a range
of aternlatives running from the status quo to ab-
soute discretion, or anarchy as you choose to call
it. Even granting that the latter may be somewhat
extreme, I feel that there is little evidence to sup-
port an opinion that three girls is necessarily more
safe than two under the conditions outlined. True
the number has been three for some time, but tra-
dition in itself does not sanctify a rule, and there
are many on this campus who feel that all rules,
be they broken or maintained, must be reviewed and
adjusted from time to time to meet changing condi-
tions and attitudes. ses ae

Proper lgihting is indeed an excellent solution,
but short of flood-lighting the campus, it would be
nearly impossible to guarantee the safety of the
student body, and even then an element of chance
would still remain, Improved lighting must defin-
itey be considered, but that in itselfwill not solve |
our problem. oe guy

Laundry Quandary, Bubbles Troubles

To the Editor:

A fact of Bryn Mawr daily life
which is not generally emphasized
by the campus guide is the state
of our laundry facilities. If a naive
or particularly embittered guide
were to describe this fully to the
prospective freshman, it is possible
that Bryn Mawr’s undergraduate
enrollment might return to its for-
mer and smaller size. Or again,
New York’s Unwashed Generation
might lose its present air of anti-
intellectual snobbery and, decid-
ing that we are, after all, kindred
spirits, descend on us in droves. :

At present, there is approxim-

ately one washing machine to each
120 students. Even if we exclude

half the college, presuming that it
attains cleanliness in some other
manner, this leaves 60 girls shar-
ing one machine. Actually, the
numbers are even larger than
this, for it seems that at least two
of the machines are invariably out,
of order. ‘Moreover, the hopeful
laundress must attempt to wash
her belongings between the hours
of 8:30 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. On
weekdays; this is often impossible
because of lack of time, what with
classes, labs, meetings, teas, etc.
On weekends it is impossible be-
cause of the long lines of other
people who have also put washing
off till then. Even if a girl is both



lucky and crafty and has managed

at an opportune moment to insert
her laundry load into a function-

ing machine, she has no place to_

dry her clothes but in the already
bedizened bathroom or in‘ her own
room—two equally unattractive
alternatives,

What I should like wistfully to .

suggest is that the students of
Bryn Mawr ‘be provided with the
opportunity to be clean. At least
the laundry rooms might be kept
open till 9:30 or so at night, giv-
ing girls with busy schedules a
chance to launder during the week.
Three or four, more machines,
three or four dryers, a clean loca-
tion for them—this seems too fan-
ciful to be more than a dream.
Still, one can’t help but wonder if
there might not be some place on
campus where the wiring ‘would
not collapse with the extra elec-
trical ‘burden. The machines are
not much of an expense; in one or
two years I am sure they would
pay for themselves. Still, I would
hesitate to suggest that the Ad-
ministration pay for this; they
seem to be kapt busy with further
polishing of Batten House and
heating our numerous swimming
pools. Perhaps Undergrad might
take it in hand. Their function is
to tend to the welfare of the stu-
dent ibody—what about its cover-
ing?

To the Editor:

A thought: how would the stu-
dent body respond to the idea of
having a regular movies series
with good foreign and Hollywood
movies shown on campus? Con-
necticut College does this with
much success, drawing not ony
the college community but people
fromthe whole area. Admission
is generally 35¢, more or less, de-
pending on the rental price of the

film. [Brown shows—cartoons—and-

Walt Disney movies all during ex-
am weeks, and this too has been
successful, as a way of relief from
academic pressures.

The transportation and admis-

{sion costs for goimg into Philadel-

phia are such that prevent'a great
deal of traffic to desirable movies,
so perhaps we could do something
about it. :

It might be that Undergrad
could do something with this idea
if there were student interest.

‘No, doubt Haverford would co-
operate if approached.

‘This campus is enough like a
cemetery during the week; week-
ends are that much worse. Not all
of us escape for weekends and thus
we end up at the Bryn Mawr movie
theatre out of desperation, enjoying
litle more than the pleasure of sin-
cere sarcasm directed at the film
we see before us.

I have no knowledge of specific
things to do about it, but surely

It has been said that the office of the president -

of Self-Gov is limitless. This is quite true, I think.
She is obviously checked both constitutionally and
by custom in her position as president. But what
limits there are do not prevent her from feeling out
the nature of her job and, to a large extent, deter-
mining the boundaries of her job for herself. From
the point of view of mental energy and the hours
spent with people ‘on both sides of the law’, she
must.fix her own limits.

The president has at least three ant meetings a
week, and two other meetings when necessary.
These meetings include chairing the Advisory and
(Executive Boards of SelfGov, and sitting on the
Executive Board of Undergrad, the Academic Honor
Board, and College Council. She is thus involved
in many different aspects of the community, all of
which aré valuable to her in observing and under-
standing the way of life at Bryn Mawr; consequent-
ly, she is often called upon to give both her opinion
and that of Self4Gov when an idea is up for discus-
sion,

There are a number of “seasonal” duties to which
the president must attend, such as measuring’ the
snowfall with her trusty ruler before breakfast.
But on the whole one cannot say exactly what the
president will encounter during her term of office.
Her duties might range from helping the hall pres-
idents decide on Christmas Dinner speakers to dis-

Interview Errata

To the Editor:

In my interview on the subject
of Mr. Shapiro’s recent essays I
must have expressed myself badly
at one point. In the list of dis-
tinguished poets whom Mr. Sha-
piro appreciates — let us say —
more than J do, the name of Rob-
ert Frost should not have been in-
cluded. Actually, Shapiro’s pass-
age in praise of Frost seemed to
me to be a sort of parenthesis,
having little to do with his main
argument, and I quite agreed with
him. It does not. necessarily fol-
low. that, if Mr. Shapiro admires
a poet. I do not, although I might
have made it sound like that.

Please let me say quite clearly |
that I know very well that Robert
‘Frost is one of the grand masters |
of our time. .
Sincerely yours,
Richmond Lattimore

Everybody talks about segregation, but nobody ©

thinks about it! At Bryn Mawr, the emphasis is on

individuality, but somewhere we have lost sight of
the force of each individual. Every citizen is faced
with the problem of the present situation in the
South. This is particulary applicable to us because
it involves our fellow-students in Southern univer-
sities. Expelled, ostracized, physically humiliated,
ti.ey have stood up for their ideals with quiet
strength. We cannot stand with them—we do not
suffer, we are not praised. But if we raise our
voice it will be heard. Let’s stop our passive atti-

Dear Editor:

While our fellow citizens in the South are mis-
treated for trying to defend their natural rights ‘as
human beings and citizens of the United States,
we at Bryn Mawr meander through our booky lives
unaware of and not caring about their struggle. In ~
seeking to be valued as individuals and not as mem-
bers of a minority race, these students are testing
the foundations of the democratic system. The
future of our country, and of free peoples every-
where depends upon the right of every individual
to vote, find employment and be accepted according
to his ability. ;

The very least that we here can do is raise our
heads from our books and look beyond our cloister-
ed lives to recognize the tremendot i

them for their valor as they quietly but firmly fight
to secure their legitimate ends.

Review Of Seeger

To the Editor:

Perhaps it is uncalled for, but I
fee] that a small defense of Mike
Seeger is necessary after the re-
view of his concert which appear-
ed last week in the News,

It is not the fault of the re-
porter that the article is unjust
and incomplete—anyone whose ear
was untrained in this kind of folk
music (“country music”, “South-
ern Mt. style” or whatever you
want to call it) might make the
mistakes she made. If she had
proclaimed her dislikes of the style
and based it on some knowledge of
folk music I would have no quib- -
ble, but she makes judgments on
it which damn it unthinkingly and
unwisely. |So I just want to clar-
ify,

To criticize Mike for a nasal
twang and a tapping foot is exact-
ly like saying “the trouble ‘with
Alexander Pope is that he writes
in rhymed couplets” — a nasal
twang and, foot, tapping are indig-
enous to the kind of singing he
does, like them or not. With South-
ern Mountain singers the accent
is one of their native speech—
they sound the same when they
talk; criticize Mike for affecting
it if you want—I wouldn’t. There
is something in the music which
demands it. The tapping foot is
not mere exuberance of spirit—
it keeps the beat and is, in a way,
as much an instrument as the one
the singer holds in his hands. Mike
is not being quaint. He is sincere-
ly attempting to capture the flav-
or of the music he plays, and he
succeeds admirably, _

As we come back to Bryn Mawr
from literally the ends of the
earth, some questions come to mind
which are not accompanied by ans-
wers. Perhaps you may be able
to answer them.

In our lives and travels this sum-

mer, when most of us were faced
with disturbing awareness of prob-
lems affecting other people’s lives
and perhaps even our own, did any
of us find it hard to forget these
matters? Or have we returned
resigned to the conviction that
nowadays there is very little of
significance that we can do to help
out, no matter how much we might
ike to?
“How many of us are haunted by
a sense—however vague—of Re-
sponsibility for much of what hap-
pens to the world as we mature
and look on, or look away? And
is there anywhere the feeling that
maybe if this growing sense of
concern and responsibility were
encouraged and channeled, then
maybe, just maybe we could be
prepared to do a little something
when we go out into the world
for good?

Could it be that there are faculty
members who really believe that
part of their responsibility as

Risible Acting

The story is about a German-
Jewish family around the turn of
the century. The father is played
by Menasha Skulnik, This was
my first-encounter with this de-
lightful actor. He made the whole
performance come alive each time

he appeared.

Father Henpecks

A strict father, he has kept his
three daughters from marriage,
and their situation has worsened
by his retirement from business.
In addition, as his school-teacher
daughter puts it, “Ever since Pa
came home, God has moved: into
the spare bedroom.” God is Mr.
Lowe’s best friend, and they are
constantly having rather heated
one-sided discussions:

Three Themes Appear

There are three central themes
in the play: (Mr. Lowe’s ambition
to be again president of the Re-
form Temple which he founded,
Tracy’s wish to be assistant prin-
cipal of her school, and the young-
est daughter Carrie’s desire to
marry a Russian. According to
Mr. Lowe a Russian Jew is only
better than a Hungarian Jew. Mat-
ters become worse when Tracy de-
cides to marry the principal of
her school. He imsists that he is
acceptable because he is an athe-
ist. The objection—he is a Christ-
ian atheist,

One other role deserves mention
here—that of the oldest daughter.
Martha Scott plays the part. It
is long, and not particularly color-
ful. (Miss Scott does a very good
job of sustaining “it: Saaremaa

Pathos and Accent

Describing the comedy further
would involve repeating’ lines out
of context—lines full of amuse-
ment, pathos, and a delightful
Yiddish accent. It cannot be done.

The play can be recommended
for entertainment, but one cannot
avaid saying that it does have a
limited appeal, because of its eth-
nic character. Nonetheless, it does
provide an enjoyable vening, for
humor is, after all, universal!

In Africa, Student Meets
‘Adventure Every Second’

by Alison Baker

“I’m not sure whether I left part
of me in Africa or part of Africa
in-me,” said Jan Douglass, speak-
ing of her summer as a participant
in a program called “Crossroads
Africa.”

The group first spent one month
in the jungle on a work project,
and then about a month and a half
traveling in Africa. + The site of
the work project was in the Cam-,
eroons, 200. miles into the bush.
The group lived with the Kaka peo-
ple and built them a church. “We
were supposed to build”a church
for 1000 people, with nothing to
go by exeept some vague plans
drawn up by an MIT student.”
This required much _ ingenuity:
breaking rocks into pebbles, and

using beer bottles in cement col-
umns for stained glass windows.

In general, Jan was not favor-
ably impressed with the mission-
aries, most of whom were Ameri-
‘can Presbyterians. “They were
not good Christians or good repre-
sentatives of America.” She quot-
ed one as saying, “I didn’t come
out-here-to-lovethese people. I
came out to preach the gospel.”
However, she did meet a couple of
missionary families who were do-
ing a fine job.

The missionaries treated Jan’s
group just as workers, but the
Africans did everything possible
to be ‘friendly: “We got to know
the Africans, and to understand
the--village.After-a dinner of
‘Fufu’ and monkey meat, we talk-
ed with African students - (in
French). The king would send
his drummers and dancers, and
soon we were doing the drumming
and dancing ourselves.”

Gorilla Reincarnation

“In the bush,” Jan remarked,
“you get used to bugs. One day a
gorilla came into the village. The
Africans have a superstition that
the dead come back as gorillas.
You just have to talk to them and
tell them to go ‘back to the dead.”

The fact that they were working
together made it easy for the mem-
bers of the group and the Africans

who helped, to get to know and|/

trust one another. A few Amer-
icans suffered from cultural shock,
but only ome was sent home—be-
cause of sickness. On weekends
they were free to go off to other
small villages. Jan started fre-
quenting the local night club, which
had ‘good cross-section of people.

In that particular county of the
Cameroons, there is a big division
betweeen civil and tribal law, which
causes great confusion. The king
still has the real avenue to the
people, but he co-operates with
the Prefect. Once, when the Cross-
roads Africa group discovered
some clothes missing, they had to
resort to the king’s bodyguard, as

the gendarmerie was no use in
finding -them,.__

“When we left (the village) I’ve
never been so sad in my life. We
had a dedication of the church,
and it seemed to be a lasting mon-
ument.in friendship as well as a
building.”

Luxurious Brice

In her travels after leaving the
Cameroons, Jan was impressed
with the luxury and beauty of the
big cities. “None of these coun-
tries is as poor as the Cameroons.
In Ghana we saw what is known
as the most beautiful college in
the world.” All over Africa they
met with tremendous warmth,
hospitality and kindness, The Af-

“American.group had invited some |’

Africans to dinner, and mistaken-
ly put all the food out on the table,
which meant that they had to go
hungry while their guests took
away what they hadn’t finished.

Ugly Americans

“There is an adventure every
single second. Every time’ you
turn around you meet someone
interesting.” The Africans are
very proud of their cultural. heri-
tage. They are also very anxious
to come to the United States to
study, and education of any sort
is highly prized. Technicians and
teachers from other countries are
in great demand, and are given
every possible advantage in the
way of help and housing.

In speaking of Afro-American
relations, Jan remarked that “some
of the American embassy officials
are real ‘ugly Americans’.” Also,
articles of racial discrimination in
the States appear in African news-
papers. “I was asked many em-
barrassing questions. They’re very
|concerned with the color question.”
Schweitzer is by no means univer-
sally popular. Many smashed him
saying he has no feeling for the
African people; and-plays the-role
of a great white father.

“IT have nothing but thanks and
admiration for the African peo-
ple,” Jan said; “and so many of
them sent their heartfelt hellos
and greetings to America and the
American people.” However, she '
also mentioned the intense threat
of Communism. “All of Africa

from anyone.” |So far, Russia has
been much more forward than the
United (States in offering that
much-needed aid.

ing majority for the Kennedy-

straw-ballot of the entire college
community, to be conducted ‘this

in next week’s News.

Following are the election opin-

Mrs. McCaffrey: “Kennedy. I

Democratic Party (one wing of. it,

This skeleton story is relayed
through the camera; it is therefore
hard to review. The extreme and

sides of life plays on the viewer's
sensitivities. Judith sees love as a
wrestling match; we, through her
eyes, are forced to watch a match
and note the actions of the wrest-

with Judith on dates, to burlesque
houses, to car wash places, to a
beauty parlor, to a revival meet-

each scene forces the viewer to
comprehend Judith’s revulsion and
to feel similarly repelled from age,
disease, contact of bodies, belief,
companionship. People really are
awful.

Judith and the man who appears

in the film; the rest is real, sord-
idly, vulgarly, terribly real, every
last scene. There is no beauty in
this film. The viewer “would like

same — reunification of Germany.
The point is made and reiterated
several times along with the ne-

troops in Berlin, of not yielding, of
continuing negotiations, and in
general of carrying out the present

It seems imposible that all Berlin-

Therapeutic Dance

by Ellen Rothenberg

Nicole Schupf set aside the gui-
tar_she had _beenstrumming~and’
smiled engagingly. “You’re here
for an interview,aren’t you?” she
asked. I admitted the point and
asked her to tell me about herself.

“Freshman Show is going to-be
marvelous!” she began. “We really
have something to say in it, and I
think we're saying it right. It’s
all about the revival of romanti-
cism—in. a satirical vein, of
course!”

‘Some few minutes elapsed before
I had a chance to explain that I
was interested not only in Fresh-
man Show but in Nicole herself as
its director. Nicole took the dis-
closure ‘well but couldn’t resist re-
marking, “But Freshman Show is
so much more interesting!”

Theater as Philosophy

I soon found out that the play
is just one of Nicole’s interests.
Planning to major in philosophy,
she sees the theater as one way of
tackling the problems her subject

poses.



Freshman Show Director,

“The wonderful thing about phi-
losophy,” she said, “is that all phi-
losophers are trying to answer the
same questions, yet each comes up
with a new sort of answer, I want
to compare their answers and. try.
to apply them to my own life.”

After her undergraduate work,
Nicole wants to go into psychia-
try. |

“The psychiatrist and the phi-
losopher are both trying to solve
the same problems,” she explained,
“only they use two different. ap-
proaches. I’d like to be familiar
with both.”

Loves to Dance

The director feels that her chief
talent is dancing and considers
dancing the ultimate in expression.

“Dancing presents ideas through

pure form,” she told me. “It doesn’t
have to use words, Words,” she
added, “are often the surest way
to ruin meaning.”

Writhing in essential soul,
I asked what sort of dancing she
wanted to do. Nicole spoke of
modern dance as her favorite and
then added that she was interested
in another kind which combines
dancing with psychotherapy. Cer-
tain psychiatrists have advanced
the theory that each psychosis has
its own movement and that doctors
can communicate with patients
who are too withdrawn to speak
‘by copying their particular action.
This assures the patient of the
therapist’s eagerness to help him

of course, whether or not we want
to incorporate our studies into our

how is one to explain the fact that
so little discussion about topics we
study go on outside classrooms?
Are we uninterested or do we feel
inadequate? Do we have a teach-
er to organize it and suggest ques-
tions, provide correct answers, or
do we simply forget that so much
reading means, we hope, at least
one-half so much knowledge, and
that this knowledge can come alive
if we compare to apply it to new
subjects and facts and problems?
Do we forget that the next student
has probably seen another side of
the same question, and that to-
gether we may find more sides to
it, and enjoy it immensely? Does

this have to happen in an organ-

Dear Editor,
May some students write .con-
cerning Mrs. Carie Kirwan War-

Franzblau’s lecture as reported in
the College News? It is unfortun-
ate that Mrs. Warfield, an author
and pareht, was not present at
the lecture ‘given by Dr. Franz-
blau, M.D., psychiatrist, PhdD.,
Doctor of Divinity, author, and
parent, For had she been in at-
tendance she might have realized
that Dr. Franzblau was not con-
demning religion’s place in society.
Rather he was attempting to show
the different roles that psychiatry
and religion assume; but, that de-
spite the differences, they should
supplement each other in guidiig
the individual and helping him to
attain an enriched, well adjusted,
and adaptable life, i.e., a state of
emotional maturity.

It is also disconcerting to read
such unfounded generalities as:
“Psychiatry is a knife; religion is
a torch,” “The great fact is that
religion works and psychiatry does
not”.—On what grounds do you
base these statements?—on the
Crusades, the Thirty Years’ War,
the Nazi régime?—or on the ex-
periences of the thousands of peo-
ple who have had_ gratifying
psycho-therapy ?

Religion can help to open the
“Divine Door’(?), But psychia-
try can help us to understand what
is behind that door and why we
wanted to open it in the first place.

Sincerely,

Ed. notes

The NEWS welcomes the
idea of controversial topics for
lectures and is glad to print
varying opinions on them. It
is especially important to ex-
pose ourselves to viewpoints
which seem strange and unten-
able to us: because we don’t
agree with them. The discus-
sion aroused by the Franzblau
lecture and Mrs. Warfield’s re-
ply is good in that it is discus-
sion—an exchange of opinion
on a subject of intellectual
merit.

Your remarks in the editorial of
22 March 1961 invite some com-
ment. You say “... there seems
to be a lack of recent works on
political science, economics, sociol-
ogy, etc. in our library.” (Since 1
July 1960 the College has spent
over $5,500 on this type of book, a
not..inconsiderable .sum. History,
though sometimes considered one
of the social sciences, is not includ-
ed in your list, though it should be
noted that over $1,000 has been
spent in the same period on his-
tory books. (Most of this almost
$7,000 has been expended on what
you term “recent books,” and in
addition, about $1,000 on books con-
cerned with problem areas—the
Far East and Africa.

Your comment about the lack
of “best” sellers is of course true..
There is no provision in the lib-
rary’s budget for this type of book,
but it may be of interest to note
that of the 16 titles in the Best
Seller “Fiction” List in the New
York Times Book Review five titles
were deemed worthy of purchase
for the library, and in the “Gener-
al” List eight of the 16 are here.
Such books as Coward’s “Pomp
and Circumstance” and De Vries’
“Through the Fields of Clover”
and even Kerr’s “The Snake Has
All the Lines” generally come to
the library as gifts, but only after
their “best seller’ days are over.
[In the meantime, the Bryn Mawr
reader who wants them currently,
will find them in the public libra-
ries or in the rental libraries of
the local bookstores,

The “Do not touch books” are
currently being worked on. They
are shelved where they are, not to
tantalize the library’s wayfarers,
but because of a notable lack of
storage space in the present lib-
rary building. With gift books
coming to the library at the rate
of an average of over 3,000 a year,
it is not as simple as it sounds “to
weed out those which are dupli-
cates and get them on the shelves”.

(Dear Undergraduates;

As a “grass root,” once again,
I am truly desirous of reaching as
many of you as possible before J
am pulled out of the ground for
good and replanted somewhere else
in the world.

In growing with Self-Gov. this
year I have learned much about
its workings and I have dreamed
of sharing with you all. Now I
feel that I can take this opportun-.
ity of doing so. I’m sure that many
of. you rarely think about Self-
Gov. except as signouts, smoking
rules, dress rules, etc. but believe
me it is so very much more than
this. You should be not only proud
of belonging to it but really trying
to make it live. Self-Gov. is truly
YOURS! it is unique in that it
represents not only the complete
spirit of Bryn Mawr | ‘put also the
ideals and desires of every single
one of you. Each one of you is no
more nor no less important to its
functioning than any other, Self-
Gov. is the individual, it IS truly
you! Should you fail to realize its
worth, the harm would be only
your own, but should you know its
value, it is the entire student body
that you help.

Concerning ‘the letter of Miss E.
Ann Eberle in your issue of April
12, I feel it my duty to deprecate
strongly her line of approach to
the problem. She seems to me,- like
too many of this campus’s adher-
ents of what I can orily call a cer-
‘tain (to put it kindly) student
group, to plunge rashly into mat-
ters without giving them due con-
sideration. She is only too ready
to commit herself without knowing
to what she is committing herself.
Such directness of approach pre-
cludes all the side issues which
make a problem interesting, not
to say significant. How. can one
be fair-minded about a problem
if it does not offer at least two
clear-cut and mutually-opposed as-
pects for one to consider at once?

Furthermore, I question whether
her grasp’ of facts in the case is
adequate. She speaks of the rele-
vant facts in the case, but she has
not considered even one irrelevant
fact. On the other hand (to be
fair-minded about it), as one of
our more liberal conservatives
once aptly put it, “There is no such
thing as an irrelevant fact. All
faets function as equally good sub-
stitutes for thinking.” (Dr. Welles-
ley Radcliffe; quoted in Ponderous
Tomes, 15th edition, pp 1197-1198).

It is the datiger of thinking which
disturbs me in Miss Eberle’s ap-

proach, \She-geuld not be more)

hastily radical if she had.deliber-
ately set out to offend the John
Birch Society. And as for taking.
a stand, she should certainly not
venture to take a strong stand at
this stage of the game; she should
not even know which leg to stand
on. She should still be considering
the endless wheels within wheels
of the matter at hand, which she
has obviously not done properly,"

Self-Gov Sees Occasion
For Student Revisions —

Object to certain self-govern-
ment rules because they are re-
stricting, arbitrary and/or unnec-
essary? Do you think it unfair
that Haverford boys may wear
Bermuda shorts to classes on our
campus when Bryn Mawr students
are forbidden do so? Do you re-
eat having to garage your Fer-
rari in Paoli when you would pre-
fer to keep it under the Pembroke
Arch? Do you wish that boys
could remain in the dorms until
12:30 on weekend nights?

If the answer to any of these
questions is yes, then take note:
presently three shall be an effec-
tive method for implementing your
jideas with action.

Quadrennially a (Constitutional
Revisions Committee is formed to
consider the purpose, need and ra-
tionality of each rule and to sub-
mit a list of suggested revisions
of these rules to the Executive
Board of the Self-Government As-
sociation. (All students who are
seriously interested in contempor-
izing the Constitution are urged

this Revision Committee by assign-
ing the list on the Self-Gov. bul-
letin board in Taylor Hall.

Since the students themselves
are responsible for the rules at
Bryn Mawr, little attention can be
afforded the passive objectors. If
you are a vehement criticizer of |

I wish to venture to cautiously
agree with the statements of your
critics in their letter in your last
issue of April 26. Point for point
I am with them‘all-the way.

I wish first to commend. their
criticism of Applebee. This is
rather hard to do, since their ob-
jection consists of the single word
‘Applbee,” which I think is a little
ambiguous. Still, I am as sure as
they obviously are that whatever
their criticism, all right-minded
persons will agree with them.

Next, their reference to Dr. Fer-
rater-Mora as F.M., A shocking
disregard for étiquette—his cor-
rect title is Ph.D. Ewen if thela
News felt that this title was too
lengthy for their spacing, they
could have surely accorded him the
simple dignity of a “V.I.P.”?

As regards the letter about Na-
nettte Fabray, I must withhold
my judgment. I might understand
the matter better if I knew who
this Miss Fabray is.

The editorial about the John
Birch Society was indeed ‘a dis-
grace. It actually implied that the
John Birch Society was simple-
‘minded and ridiculous, a_ thing
which I am sure the letter-writers
of April 26 would never suggest.

Mud-slinging at Self-Gov, for-
sooth! How dare the News dis-
parage? Don’t they appreciate
the privileges of free speech for
‘which Gelf-Gov stands? From

now on,( they can just vote ja like
the rest of us.

The last point on which I wish



the Editor

to agree “with the critics ‘is*’that
about the superfluity of the letters.
I think they have demonstrated
their point very well. I would only
like to add that I consider the ple-
thora of letters (well, three) re-
ceived on Miss Eberle’s letter an
indication of a perfectly disgrace-
ful student interest in student af-
fairs.
| In closing, I would like to ex-
tend my thanks to the News critics.
It is staunch and solid attitudes
like theirs which make my cam-
pus policy of anarchy a pleasure.
Equally sincerely (1 think),.

Ex-SG Gurgler Finds
Emphatic Empathy

Dear Editor:

. It is with pride that I in-
form you of the active moderation
and passive violence with which
your crisis is being regarded, in
the nooks and crannies of the great
institution of State - regulated
learning, the University of (Cali-
fornia at Berkeley, whose students
have built a tradition (only recent-
ly) of marching with vigor toward
the solution of all such crimes,
whether large or small, whether
social or anti-social. Crises are

to be cultivated, nurtured, cared
ie as Marshall Potter so wisely
suggested—in.an Apnil 19th letter,
with hot tea, studied-with grow-
ing understanding (here I must
suggest to T. Barrett Caples, also4
of the April 19th edition of the
News, that~any amount of under-
~ standing denotes the use of at
least and possibly more than one
leg on which a stand may be pos-
ited, thus limiting the difficulty
involved in undertsanding -to a
choice between which leg to stand
on, the right or the left one( and,
only after the seeds have been
sown, so to speak, cut, dried and
packed into the “logica] and well-
planned indignation” (here I quote
from C. E. Schaar’s outstanding
letter) without which no action
can be taken, whether by grass
roots, stink weeds, or fertilized
top soil, may the entire crop be
harvested and, as is usually the
case when crises are organized
into superstructures resting upon
bewildered ipso facto-ites, stored
away for next year.

It is not enough to define the
crisis, which, judging from the
overwhelming response to Dr. Eb-
erle’s initial letter, has been at-
tempted, and, as it were, in part.
successfully; nor is it sufficient to
criticize these noble attempts at
definition and solution, for as all
interested spectators know, it takes
only a few participants to lose the
softball game to the Faculty. Rath-
er, what is needed, nay, without
which the battle cannot be won, is

a Systematic and Honorable ap-
proach to definition and solution
within which lies, as we so often
see nowadays, the birth and re-
birth of spring-like revolutionary
spontaneity enforced only by a
careful and conscientious re-exam-
ination of the rules of self-impos-
ed discipline. This, I tremble in
my fervor, is the key; this, I has-
ten to point out, is that mystery-
of-mysteries which we, sadly of
yesteryear, neglected to write up
in approved parliamentaary style
at the end of our time, at the end
of the hour...

... remember, through the thick
and the thin of it all, those glori-
ous words of A. P. Terhune: “‘A col-
lie down is never a collie beaten.”

ly,

There are many of us in this

maid. I, in addition, feel great
pity for a student who finds her-
self in an embarrassing situation
when introducing someone to a
maid because she does not know
the maid’s last name. I heartily

either ask her parents or perhaps
consult an etiquette book as to the

Curriculum Group
Collects Opinions

The Curriculum Committee, which
met under the direction ‘of Ginny Sitz,
Thursday, October 19, discussed many

tions of general policy, related to the
Bryn Mawr course of study.

The exact nature of honors work

in the various departments was a ma-
jor topic for discussion. It was
brought out that the requirements
and conceptions of honors’ work vary
from department to department. Sev-
eral people questioned the validity
of having honors work apply only to
one’s major subject. It was decided
to devote a whole meeting of the
Committee to these questions.
A suggestion was made to have
a two-day reading period before ex-
ams, to lessen the crush of work
directly before the exam period, One
objection to this plan is that there
is no assurance that a reading period
will be used for purposes of study.
Nevertheless; the plan was taken
under consideration.

The two-language requirement at
It
was felt that many students take one
year of a language merely to “pass
the requirement” and derive little ac-
tual benefit from that one year. On the
other hand, some of those present felt
that knowledge—even a slight knowl-
edge—of two languages was invalu-
able for graduate study.

Standards & Exchange

The exchange of Bryn Mawr-Hav-
erford students came under discus-
sion. Since the two schools do have
different course loads and somewhat
different marki standards, many
felt. it would be ‘Wfficult to further
unite the courses.

mentioned. Most of the members of

NuclearThreat Demands
Bilateral Disarmament

To the Editor:

The remotest thought of nuclear
war precipitates a horror-stricken re-
action on the part of the American
Public. However justified this re-
spect for the potential of nuclear en-
ergies, it should not result in a panic-
stricken escapism.

’ The nuclear-policy goals for Amer-
ica, and indeed the world, should be
two: first, a mature and realistic ac-
knowledgement of the facts of nuclear
energy; second, the formulation of a
policy which is based on these facts
and which is directed toward disar-
mament. But no matter. how desir-
able the second goal may be, we can-
not hope to ‘achieve it without having
attained the first,

The overwhelming fact of the nu-
clear age is ignorance, We can only
guess at the effect and duration of
fall-out; we can only hope that bomb-
shelters serve a purpose; we can only
pray that an accident does not start
a nuclear struggle; we can only trust
that the Soviets are as adverse to
becoming involved in a nuclear strug-
gle as we; we can only assume that
somewhere there lies a solution.

When the awareness of this ignor-
ance is combined with the abstract

| realization of the superlative meaning

of nuclear power, we can neither be
complacent nor unconcerned.

Man-Made Menaces

~ What is the best way of coping
with, this man-made..menace?—-The
most reasonable alternative is to es-
tablish a strong defensive network.
A network which is consistently as
invulnerable and as formidable as
possible could be the strongest single
deterrent to nuclear war. Granted,
accidents can happen, and misunder-
standings can occur, but in the face
of incomplete victory, what nation
will risk nearly total destruction?

If we unilaterally disarm (even
temporarily as an experiment) we
automatically indicate an optimism
which is too naive and unrealistic to
be valid. I know of no lasting and
universally respected piece of nego-
tiation which is not made meaningful
by force. I know of no reason to
believe that man will act morally
when assured of gain through im-
morality.

The creed in a universal morality
is perhaps the finest creed of all, but
it is too tenuous to be a just and
solid basis for international action.

Disarmament must be bi-lateral.
Disarmament must be the product of
an honest and mutual realization that
nuclear war is a dead-end street. Dis-
armament on any other grounds
would be political suicide.

not only affect students, but every

which requires thought, logic, judg-

and we do, that mastering the arts
of judgment and articulation could
well be included in an education for
effective living. And, say we, what .

for ungrounded opinion. Speaking without knowledge is
simple enough, and is certainly no solution. Neither will
Akoue supply answers to problems. Rather its function as
we now see it, will be to provoke thinking about topics which
concern us: questions will be raised, and these questions will
be researched as extensively as possible, but the answers
will be thought out by the readers, who, we hope, will have
a fair amount of knowledge about the topic because some of
the research will have been done ‘for them. At the end df
each issue we shall print a bibliography of pertinent books
and articles. The issues discussed will pertain to student life
in a broad sense: to those aspects of student life which relate
us to the outside world, either to other colleges, to the U. S.
government, or to movements going on in the world.

For this issue; we have decided. to-begin at. Bryn Mawr,
and to question our position here and now: to see where we
are and why; to see where we are going and why; to see
from where we have come and why. Bryn Mawr has a unique
tradition; we are part of an exciting line of innovating wom-
en, and we think that it is essential that we undergo, each of
us, somewhat of an agonizing reappraisal.’ We must look into
this line, and see whether we agree with its development; if
we do, we must see where we fit into the line, or where, if we
don’t, we have individually gone wrong: The ultimate pur-
pose of the paper resides in action; at least in active thought
and discussion, if not in an involvement in action already
taking place, or in starting action where necessary. What
better opportunity have we for beginning than right here

on campus where our voices can and should be heard, where

we are not powerless but can make a difference? After we
have in some measure understood our place here at school,
we can begin to understand and act regarding our position in
relation to the outside world.

Certainly, the purpose of the paper is not yet fixed, and
perhaps we shall find that our direction is not really the best
one, but we felt that a journal with this basic function was a
necessity at this time. We have no permanent staff, and no
set ideas for further issues. This will come, we hope, from

any interested members on campus who are willing to help.

think up topics, to debate them, to research them, or to write
them. Anyone who has the desire is welcome to join, and
need but contact the editor. For those not interested in par-
ticipating directly, please send us your suggestions, for they
will be greatly appreciated. Those not interested, or unable

Albee Finds Europe Warmer

Towards Experimental Plays

Edward Albee spoke under the
auspices of the Arts Council Novem-
ber 28, Mr. Albee, whose four short
plays have all enjoyed success in the
United States, gave a speech which
he admitted he had previously given
in Buenos Aires when The Zoo Story
was presented there. He asked his
audience at Bryn Mawr to pretend
they were Argentines for the pur-
‘poses §. He"" speech.

Mr. Albee discussed his own exper-
ience as a new young American play-
wright—not because he particularly
enjoys talking about himself, he as-
sured his listeners, but because he
thought they might be interested in
his rather unusual position. ©

“Mr. Albee cited several reasons
why people go into the theater—de-
sire for money, a love for the thea-
ter, the hope of a supposedly easy
way to make a living, and, rarely, the
“vision, dedication, gall, and steel
will . . . which is sometimes called
talent.” He then asserted that he,
himself, had come into the theater
by “dereliction.” At the age of thirty,
having failed commercially at poetry
and novel-writing, Mr. Albee wrote

culture (Biblical or Greek Literaturé)
in terms of its influence on the main-
springs of all literature, or through
the study of a wide range of English
literature (English 101). Both ele-
mentary Greek and Latin 101, how-
ever, fulfill the literature require-
ment. Is this consistent with the
stated purposes of the curriculum?
Or should the requirement be. fulfill-
ed by any survey literature course in
any foreign language?

At the present time, 33% of the
senior class does honor papers. This
is the culmination of the “breadth
and depth” philosophy of the college.
Miss Meigs in What Makes a Col-
lege? states that “every mind has its
own single and best direction, and
it is the true flowering of complete
education when that mind can follow,
under its own effort, its own innate-
ly appropriate way.’ Should the sen-
ior paper be mandatory for all, or
optional for any student interested in
it? (This latter system has been in-
stituted at Harvard, where the under-
graduate works on his. thesis under
the personal direction of either gra-
duate students or faculty members.)

Since we as students are so inti-
mately involved in Bryn Mawr Col-
lege and its philosophy, it is only
right that we ask ourselves whether
the depth and breadth policy is what
we want in our education. If a stu-
dent prefers taking a greater num-
ber of courses in various subjects
rather than spending so much time
on one, if she wants more depart-
ments, more courses a year, then

aqpssibly she~ should” consider trans-
ferring to a larger school, not com-
mited, as is Bryn Mawr, to the ideal
of training scholars in one field.

On the other hand, if we accept
bryn Mawr’s philosophy, it is our
responsibility as students to make
sure Bryn Mawr is consistent with
it and is successful in achieving her
goal. Both the administration and
the faculty are easily accessible to
students at Bryn Mawr. The Self-
Government Association and Under-
graduate Association are student or-
ganizations both accessible and pow-
erful. ‘Through these organizations
each student can have a meaningful
voice.

There is altogether too much dis-
cussion and too little action on the
Bryn Mawr campus. The smok
ate alive with students’ comptaibes'



day present to himself, he added.

Since Broadway producers consid-

ered the play “too short” to be a suc-
cess, Thé Zoo Story was first produc-
ed in West Berlin. When he decided
to travel to Berlin for the premiere
of the play, Mr. Albee was asked by
many of his friends why he was sud-
denly going to Germany. His reply
was: “Oh - - there’s a play I want
to see there.”
. While in Europe, Mr. Albee made
an important discovery about the
European theater. He found out that
the European experimental play-
wrights were not “prophets without
honor in their own land”’—as is often
the case, he believes, in America.
The new playwrights were present-
ed in the large theaters of their coun-
tries and were given serious, wide-
spread attention. This attitude in
Europe led him to hope that the same
regard for the experimental theater
could eventually be fostered in Amer-
ica.
Mr. Albee mentioned that after
what he termed a fifteen year “black
period” in the American theater, he
and two other young playwrights,
Jack. Richardson and Jack Gilbert,
had begun to write serious, experi-
mental drama. He felt that all three
were “taken on as a cause by the
press” and were “vastly over-apprais-
ed.” “Only beginning practitioners,
we were encouraged to think of our-
selves as authorities,’ he said.

Mr. Albee mentioned one more
experience he had had as a modern
playwright in America. The Zoo
Story was produced in Westport, a
town Mr. Albee characterized as “con-
servative,” with a “higher per capita
income than most of the nation” and
given to “wife-sharing.” The people
in Westport strongly objected to the

play, finding it communistic,gbscene,
“unfavorable and, therefore, ufitrmue-

Were it not for the intervention of
Governor Stevenson, Mr. Albee felt
that there was a strong possibility
that the citizens of Westport, by
their agitation in the Congress and
State Department, might have pre-
vented the play from going to Argen-
tina.

From this experience, Mr. Albee
concluded that “all too many people
in my country believe in self-delu-
sion.” There is a “pressure on the
writer in the United States from his
audience for him to lie.” In conclud-
ing his speech, Mr. Albee warned
against this complacency in Amer-
ican writing and cautioned Americans
to avoid “dictatorship of the middle
brow.”



representative about the material cov-
ered in a course, why not discuss
with a professor the particular prob-
lems of his course? Student respon-
sibility, which is the basis of Bryn
Mawr’s educational philosophy, is not
only a guide but also a challenge. We
are avoiding responsibility by cram-
ming for tests and writing papers
the night (and often early morning)
before they are due. This slipshod
method of work does not teach the
student anything, does not fulfill
Bryn Mawr’s expectations for her,
and is completely inconsistent with
the philosophy of depth, We often
complain about the downright dull-
ness of some class discussions, but
never think of the professor’s dilem-
ma in trying to stimulate discussion
among students who have not done
the necessary reading. Too often
Bryn Mawr students sit in silence,
neither demanding further clarifica-
tion of points, nor daring to chal-
lenge a professor’s point jof view.
How can we even pretend ito be in-
telligent and thinking individuals
when we passively sponge up what-
ever is told us, without self-doubt,
questioning, or active criticism?
Bryn Mawr seeks to make us well-
educated, independent, and thought-
ful individuals. The process of ed-
ucation, however, is a very personal

| and individual, task, and thus a per-



the responsibility is ours.

Christmas Concert
Will Offer Music
Of Spanish Nature

by Anne Witman

The combined Bryn Mawr-Haver-

ford Chorus will present its annual
Christmas concert as an offering to
campus: festivities, December 10 in
Goodhart. and December 11 in Rob-
erts Hall, Haverford. The Haverford
Glee Club will sing three numbers,

“Song of Praise in the Dorian Mode,”

by Franz Phillip, “O Magnum Mys-
terium,” by Jacobus Handl, and “Ca-
rol: While Shepherds Watched Their
Sheep,” by’ Hugo Jungst, under the
direction of Mr. William Reese.:

Mr. Robert Goodale, director of the
Bryn ‘Mawr Chorus, spent the past
year in’ Spain, engaged in musical
research, and for this reason, this
yéar’s musical focus is naturally
Spanish. The chorus will perform
five carols from the 16th and 17th
centuries in the concert, “Valame
Dios,” anonymous; “Llorando ésta
en un portal,” anonymous; “Angeles
del cielo,” anonymous; “Los Reynes
siguen la estrella,” by . Francisco
Guerrero, and “Para regalo,” by
Juan Bautista Comes.

Two kinds of religious music ex-
isted during the 16th and 17th cen-
turies in Spain. The first type was
composed of liturgical texts, written
for church services, such as masses
and motets. The style of this music

was essentially contrapuntal, resem- !

bling Palestrina. The second type
was written on non-liturgical texts,
also to. be performed in the church,
which are folk-like in character. The
five pieces the chorus will sing are
of this type and were designed to
appeal to the Spanish pueblo com-
munity. There is a great similarity
betwen this music and the secular
music of the same period, both of

bwhich are called canciones. Francisco

Guerrero, for example, wrote a col-
lection of secular pieces and later

Thomas

Continued from Page 1, Col. 3

The bomb shelter race is also, in
Mr. Thomas’ view, an example of
the degeneration of law and morality
in the face of fear and insecurity. Mr.
Thomas also opposes bomb shelters
because they cannot provide protec-
tion from blast, fire, storm or deoxy-
genation of the air and are, there-
fore, of little use if a bomb is actu-
ally dropped. He is against the con-
struction of shelters because he feels
this will engender a shelter race as
well as the production of bombs big
enough to destroy the shelters.

More important to consider, he
said, is what society will be like if
one accepts the conjecture of survival.
A rigorous dictatorship is the only
possibiltiy.

If the system of law and morality
breaks down because people assume
the right to shoot others who might
want. to share their shelter, said- Mr.
Thomas, one cannot expect a return
to freedom and ethical standards in



the chaos that will inevitably follow

a nuclear catastrophe. ; :

Until the publications of Akoue,
those people concerned with apathy
at Bryn Mawr could have used: the
College News as Exhibit A for their
case. Until the publication of Akoue,
the News, especially in its weak, un-
satisfactory editorials, did not offer
much of significance or even of in-
terest to the reader. Akoue presents
a refreshing change in its construc-
tive, well-informed, thoughtful ap-
proach. We would like to see it ap-
pear more often than every six weeks
—in fact every week. For we hope
it will soon become an integral part
of the -News,;-raising the standard
not only of the editorials, but also
eventually of the drama and music
reviews. We like to think that the
publication of Akoue will be an im-
portant step toward a review and
subsequent overhaul of the News.

~ The’ following letter appeared as an advertisement in the
PHILADELPHIA EVENING BULLETIN, December 15; 1961.
It also carried signatures of faculty members at other colleges and
universities in the. Greater Philadelphia area.



An Open
President

We are deeply disturbed by current developments in the

field of civil defense. It appears
of our peopie is being channeied

reasons; and that continuation of this trend may be extremely dan-
gerous to the nation and to civilization itself.

The Effect of Large Nuclear
; Weapons

WE are now in tne era of 50 to 100
megaton. bomps. Accoraing to tne AcC
estimate ot Uctober 1, a IUU megaton
bomp, expioded in-tne air, would nave
an \to-miie raqgius of total destruction: ot
ordinary structures, and woud ignite
most wooaen bundings in a radius ot
6U miles. _Wwitnin tnat area,.aarge pro-
portion of tne popuiation would be sut-
tocated by jack of oxygen or poisoned
by carbon monoxide. basement. sneiters
under burning buudings would be use-
less, as. wouvid biast sneiters. witnout  a°
reserve air supply. :

Admittediy, it may be, possible to de-
sign and construct a civil Getense capa-
biuty to permit national survival atter a
massive attack with such Weapons, = It:
wouid entail, at tne very least, perma-
nent, deep underground. _piacement — of
enougn of our economy and conmunica-
tion, anda sutticient decentraization. of
pubic activities, to enabie operation of
vital services immediately atter ' attack.
It also wouid require.enough public biast

everyone on a tew minutes notice, even
in. tne cities. The cost of such a pro-
gram wou.d be comparabie to tne: entire
capital investment ot tne country—severai
tnousand doulars, per person—and wouid
consume a substantial fraction . of our
gross national product for numbers of
years. There is a serious question as to
whetner tne Soviet Union wouid stand
idiy’ by while we try to make ourseives
really bomb-proof. In _ addition, we be-
lieve tnat tne prospect of living indetins
itey in an underground fortress woud
not appeal to tne nation.

The nation has not yet faced’ up to the.
real dangers of tnermonuciear war. We
believe tnat- most of our peopie do not
understand what the. worid -wovid. look
+ike--tne day- after -an--attack--or—what
problems would be involved in recover-
ing from a war which. killed, injured,
poisoned; and destroyed on such a large
scaie. Many of those who do understand
have. found: the prospect too awful and
have therefore, put tne idea from their
minds.

-Program

We are aware that our government: is
to deal realistically with the
probiem of war or peace. Unfortunate-
ly, however, government encouragement
of shelter construction, as interpreted by
the popular press, some local CD officials,
and wouid-be shelter manufacturers, has
led to a cruel deception of the people
with respect to the protection which
would be afforded, especially by indi-
vidual fallout shelters. These shelters
might be adequate in a ‘‘minor’’ atomic
war, ascould have started in-1950, Such
a conservative program has little rele-
vance to the type of large scale attack
which might be anticipated in 1962.

It is undoubtedly true that such shel-
ters in areas remote from blast centers
might temporarily keep alive a certain
number of people. However, the con-
tinued survival of those, and of civiliza-
tion as we know it, also requires the pro-
tection of the physical basis of society—
the means-of-production and of distribu-
tion, government and communication, etc.
A program for doing that is very differ-



Pspace is too short to discuss tnese at

‘ess of the cause of the war, limitation

Letter To
Kennedy

to us that the prodigious energy
into wrong directions for wrong

ent from anything now being considered.

The principal danger of the present
program is tne false sense of security en-
genaered. It is much like a quack cure
tor cancer. If we are,lucky, tne “‘treat-
ment’ may not kill us, but in the mean-
time, while the cancer is growing and
becoming incurable, we fail to go to a
feputabie pnysician for sensibie  treat-
ment. By buying a shelter program*
wnich does not sheiter, and thereby be-.
lieving tnat‘ we can survive a tnermonu-
clear war, we are increasing tne proba-
bility of war. This probability increases
potn. because we. may be more willing to
“go-to the brink“ if -we think -survviat
is possibie and because we are less like-.
ly to devise and take any. of the con-
structive steps which may. ease tension
and secure the peace. ~

Arguments in Favor of
Civit Detense
We recognize that many sincere people

support tne present civil detense program
tor what they believe are’ good reasons.

.engtn, but we have examined-them: at
length and believe they are wrong.

ror example, it is said that civil de-
fense is a deterrent. If it really protected
us to the extent necessary for surviva:
it might be; but at present its ony deter-
rent vaive lies in the.demonstration to
tne Soviet Union that we expect to- have
a war. Even on tnis point,: it mignt in
tact be argued that tnis is more likely
to precipitate a pre-emptive attack. than
to deter one.

It is sometimes said that we should
protect ourselves against a limited nu-
cear war, in which, perhaps, only a few
cities on each side wouid be destroyed.
Such a war is highly Unlikely. Regard-

wouid call for a degree of restraint_.and
mutual agreement between the -parties
which, if obtainabie 
prevent war altogether.

There is also the “anything is better
than nothing” argument. Of course, every
government has responsibilities of trying
to protect its citizens, even if. only a
relatively few of them -are likely to. sur-
vive. a disaster. The danger is that the
individualman_for whom a_ shelter is
made. at his home or place of work is
being made to feel significantly safer.
For any given person this is almost cer-
tain to prove false.

The Moral Issues

We have not touched on the moral
issues of the shelter..program—the ques-
tion of whether it is right to plan on
“losing” our cities and the ‘people in
them when decisions of war: and peace
are made, the question of defending pri-
vate shelters against intruders, the ques-
tion of abandoning millions of injured
-outside while the-rest.of us hide Under-
‘ground, the question of shelters for the
wealthy vs. shelters ‘for the poor or the
apartment dweller, the question of the
long-term effect of a shelter psychology
on the values of a democratic society—
these are important issues as well. We
have dealt here primarily with the more
pressing questions of the adequacy of
civil defense and its effect on war and
peace. A moral code does not exist in
a vacuum. If we lose this structure of
society we cannot hope to keep our
moral values.

) Investigates Spirit

_ program for peace with freedom. . This is bound to be at least as

To sum up, we believe that although the present civil defense pro-
gram, and in particular the construction of fallout shelters, might
save a small fraction of the population in a nuclear war, this poten-
tial gain is more than offset by the fact that such activity prepares
the people for the acceptance of thermonuclear war as an instru-
ment of ‘national policy. We believe that this acceptance would
substantially increase the likelihood of war—a war which would
be permanently fatal to our democratic society, even if not to all
of us. The American people are capable of great effort and sacri-
fice, We believe this effort should be directed toward a positive

difficult and time consuming as any preparation for war, and will
require the highest type of leadership for success. At the present
time the nation is not ready to\consider such a program, largely
because of widespread lack of understanding.of.justhow catas-
“trophic war today would be. We call upon.you, Mr. President,
to make this plain and then lead the nation forward on a race

Basketball Scorer

Of Doom-Doomers

When the impoverished Bryn
Mawr student. wends her way to
the Bureau of Recommendations
in Taylor basement, hoping to find
a ‘high-paying baby-sit for that
same old Saturday night, she prob-
ably-—little realizes the wealth and
variety~-of other jobs the Bureau
has to offer. I w&s such a student
this fall until ‘my horizons were
suddenly broadened when, on my
third unsuccessful trip into the of-
fice, Mis: Blake asked if I knew
anything about basketball. I learn-

ed a long time ago not to be sur-
prised whe asked this question by
basketball coaches aspiring to lure
all 5° feet 10"" inches “of me onto
their team, but I was admittedly a
iittie curious .about Mrs. Blakes’
interest in my prowess. I confessed
to a knowledge of the rudiments.
and was then informed of an open-
ing for a scorer of games in the
Philadelphia Nurses Basketball
League. I don’t know whether I
was more’ intrigued by the sound
of the job or the $3.50 a game
salary, but, in any case, I affixed
my name to the job card and in
the early weeks of November be-
came an official scorer for the first
time in my life. :

The job bears no resemblance to
babysitting unless’ it’s in the rac-
ket which emanates from every
corner of the gym. From time to
time these yells become orderly
under the competent direction of
cheer leaders. It, is at such times
that one team declares its inten-

Semester Courses —
Offer Opportunities

by Sue Weisberg

Do you: have that midyear slump?
Are you tired, unstimulated, or do
you need mental exertion?” Why not
forego your bridge game and try
taking a “b” course? Even if you
don’t get to the point of signing up
for the course, the activity of trying
to find your way through the maze
of 804a’s, 201c*, and interdepart-
mnetal (307 b) may increase your
mental stimulation. -.

Although you may want to cau-
tiously skirt the edge of such courses
as “Quantum Mechanics: of Atoms
and Molecules” and “Anatolian and
Syrian Archaelogy,” you can still
venture into a new course. “Problems
in the History of the Modern Near
East” is being given for the first
time by Mr. Silvera. “Miss Robbins’s
course on “Great Historians,” 306b,
is not new, but may also be of. in-
terest.

The English department _ offers
opportunities -for- “b” courses, as:
well. Miss Woodworth’s course on
Blake, Mr. Butman’s course on “Ad-
vanced Playwriting and Production”
and Mr. Herben’s course on “History
of the English Language,” which is
re-appearing after a year’s absence,
are all given the second semester.
If you want to try something novel
in the way of interdepartmental
courses, you might take “The Prob-
lem of Power in Contemporary So-
ciety” wth Mr. Bachrach and Mr.
Baratz.

This is but a small sampling of
what is available. For complete de-
tails see your local dean.

been the Artist in Residence since

My job as such is not difficult. I
am aided in the task of spotting

each team whose job it is to pro-
nounce loudly and clearly the name
or number of the player in ques-
tion. The talents of these spotters
vary.-The-majority—are fairly-good-
but need to be reminded from time
to time that it is last, not first
names of girls which are listed in
the. score. book and that one num-
ber sounds like every ‘other num-
ber when it is muttered sotto voce
in a direction other than my ear.
Once these points are understood
there remains the problem of -ex-
tracting the precious information
from them, since they tend. to get
as enthused as the on-lookers and
are usually urging a team member
to “take it down the other way”
while the score becomes hopelessly
confused. - a
Unfortunately, the enviable qual-
ity of sportsmanship does not al-
ways pervade the atmosphere of
the game. I suppose every umpire
has had his murder orally willed
by a frenzied spectator, but I didn’t
realize that inimical feelings can
be exercised upon the score-keeper
as well. I suppose I should be
thankful that it was not by death
but only my replacement which
was advocated in aloud voice
across the strangely silent gym by
the father of .the girl whose bas-

Professor Questions Use
Of Word ‘War’ in Article
To the Editor:

Politics and the English language
can, as we know, exert a corrupting
influence on one another. I wonder-|

current College News if the writer
is aware to what extent her thinking
is hampered by her language. She
states that we are “at war with Com-
munism—or should be.” This we can
‘recognize as a shorthand version of
the commonplace term “cold war.”
Later, in defense of military men
publicly stating their personal views,
she cites MacArthur’s ‘famous _dic-
tum, “In war there is no substitute
for victory.” But MacArthur was
not speaking of-the-cold-war and-he
was not speaking of thermo-nuclear

war. :

“Every action of every Amefican
should be directed towards the de-
struction of Communism.” In the
context she has provided, this sounds
to me liké a battle cry. And in our
time, a battle--cry to nuclear arms
foregoes the possibility of a victory.
More than one. military man_ has
warned us that this is so, including,
if I am not mistaken, General Mac-
Arthur on theo¢casion of his eighti-
eth birthday.

“War” means either the gestures
and threats and postures and sym-
bolic acts of the cold war which may
break out into local hot wars. Or
it means thermo-nuclear war, Since
neither politics nor -language car
possibly »fully represent the mean-
ing of that “war,” we give up and
imprudently use the. same old word.
Woe betide us if we confuse the two
concepts!

- German Visitors Offer Opinions
«On Berlin, American Students

' By Valerie Schoenfeldt
and Chris Whitehead

On Sunday, March 4, Bryn].
_ Mawr campus played host to three
visitors from one of the hot spots
oe the Cold War — West Berlin.
Dr. Otto Wenzel, President of the
Young. Berlin Socialists, Herr. Udo
Loewke, Representative ‘of the So-
cial Democratic Students, and Herr
Peter Mudra, President of the
Student Parliament of West Ber-
lin, arrived here at noon for a stay
which included dinner in Rhoads,
a tour of the campus, and an infor-
mal, tea with their hostesses and
Mr. Kline of the Russian and
Philosophy Departments. Dr. Wells
of the Political Science Department
contributed to arrangements’ for
the visit.
Thesthree gentlemen are mem-
bers of a group of ten, all leaders
of various German student organ-

izations, visiting the United States |

-. for two- weeks to explain conditions,
“in the divided city, present the Ger-
man view of its problems,—and-to
become better acquainted with the

«country and people “in whose
thands we are.” Dr. Wenzel, Pro-
fessor of History at the Free Uni-
versity of Berlin, is a dry-humored
scholar whose contributions to the
conversation lent .a note of preci-
sion and expertise. Herr Mudra,
genial and self-assured, combined
perceptive insights with ironic wit.
Herr Loewke was characterized by

_.@ relaxed charm and impressive
political acumen.

One purpose of the gentlemen’s
visit was to clear up the many
misconceptions of America held by
Germans. Their stay in this coun-

“try is ‘brief, but they “have learned-|~

much and have been favorably im-
pressed by the American people
and institutions with which they
have come in contact. “On their
part, the visitors were also very
informative about-the German poli-
tical scene. Herr Loewke is confi-
dent that Berlin Mayor Brandt

""(Socialist Party) will play an in-
creasingly decisive role in German
politics. \

Herr Mudra explaiiiad the ‘aferta
of West Berlin students to help
East. Germans, separated from

-. their families by the wall, to es-

cape tothe West. He could not. dis-

cuss the situation in detail because
of the danger of revealing crucial
_ information, but he described the
feats and sacrifices of students who

risked their lives to free their im-
prisoned countrymen. According to
_ Herr Loewke, more than half of
the two thousand West Berliners
caught on the wrong. side of the
wall on August 13th have been re-

_. turned to their families with. the
' aid of students.

.In. answer to many questions
about the morale of the West Ber-
lin population, Herr Loewke ex-

: plained that the flight of residents
into West Germany has created no
great problem because the West
German government offers advan-
tageous conditions (subsidies, low-
er rénts, job opportunities, etc.)
‘which are designed to attract vig-
orous young: people to the city.
This program has been so success-
ful that there is not only an influx
of “new” people from West Ger-
many, but also people who had al-
ready left the city are —
in large. numbers.

Perhaps most interesting of all
were the gentlemen's well thought~

_ out criticisms of aspects of Amer-
jean students’. political attitudes.
Herr Mudra expressed some sur-
prise over the way in which NSA
a neglected and underrated in the

U. §. and wholeheartedly advised

tion that the corresponding organ-
izations in Europe enjoy. These
not only bring about the formation

{with the future of international af-

of better scholarship seoueands and
an increase in student exchange
plans, but are at present involved
in a struggle of international sig-
nificance. For example, the stu-
dents of the new African nations
are beginning to organize, and
since the statesmen of Africa will
be drawn directly from -a— small
group of educated elite, their affili-
ations in the student world will-be
of primary jimportance in determ-
ining Africa’s position in the
East- West conflict. Herr Mudra
feels that any students concerned

fairs should take advantage of the
political potential of .an Racin
student body.

The students whom the German
group has encountered seem to
have a good grasp of the basic pre-
cepts of Marxism-Leninism, but
Herr. Mudra feared that too many
of them based their anti-commun-
ist sentiments on an unanalyzed
image of the Communist Bogey
rather—than~-on well-thought-out,

Bryn Mawr Students J udge
Aspects of Visited Colleges

Panel Cites Discussion,
Honor System Problems

Four stray Bryn Mawrtyrs
have returned to the fold
from their visits to nearby
colleges under a program of

student exchange, and, last Thurs-
day, they participated in a lively
panel discussion, moderated by
Ellen Corcoran. Meg. Porter and
Paula Pace, who spent a week at
Sarah Lawrence, traded impress-
ions with Vivian Brodkin and. Lin-
da Newman, the Swarthmore ex+
change visitors, before an inter-
ested and articulate audience which
seemed to realize the value of this
type of exchange program to the
Bryn Mawr student body.

Individualism, observed Meg and
Paula, sets the keynote for life at
Sarah Lawrence, both at the aca-
demic._and_.social__levels. Classes |.

jare small and are often conducted |

in round-table style, with much in-

dents and professors. Faculty ad-
visors act almost in. loco parentis
to their advisees: - —

The only required course is the
freshman “exploratory” course,
which may be in any discipline,
not necessarily in one in which the
student is especially interested."

During my exchange week visit
to Sarah Lawrence, I was especia]-
ly impressed by the interchange be-
tween students and faculty on
every level of community function-
ing. Sarah Lawrence is. very proud
of this aspect of their system and
in-most- situations rightly so. This —
contact with adults is a vital part

of their educational learning eng

growth.

Bryn Mawr students also have
the opportunity to - form - contacts
with faculty members outside the
classroom, but our institutional
system does not encourage this in-
formality. In fact, too many girls
feel the atmosphere prohibitive. A

problem as complex as student-

faculty relations has no easy solu-

‘tion. But if we are ready to tam-
(per with the status quo, it. seems.

that the answers other schools have
found could. serve as a guide for
possible constructive’ approaches.
Perhaps it would be worth con-
sidering a modification of the Sar-
ah Lawrence “don” system or An-
tioch’s faculty advisors. If each
student her freshman and’ perhaps
her sophomore year had one fac-
ulty member with whom she had
a rather informal academic rela- .
tionship, the impersonality of the
large 101-courses might not be so
disappointing and. depressing. This

Bewildered freshmen are plung-
ed into a barrage of elections at
the beginning of the semester, and
throughout the year have an in-
terminable number of meetings to
elect temporary “reps” to various
organizations. It’s bad enough
electing the first round of tempor-
ary reps, chairmen, and songmis-
tresses, but by the time the second
and third. rounds roll by, it’s small
Fwonder that the attendance at —
meetings has dwindled well below
quorum. level. »

Rationalizations

I have been givén only three
rationalizations for the infinite
number of both meetings and tem-
porary officers: 1) it gives us a
chance to get. acquainted with each.
other and achieve “class, unity”; 2)
it gives more freshmen a chance to
participate in Bryn Mawr organ-
izations; 3) it gives members of
the class better knowledge of the
capabilities of the candidates run-
ning for the permanent offices.

In my opinion, freshmen meet
each other in the halls, at. Lan-
tern “Night rehearsals, and work: ~
ing—on- the. Freshman._Show.. At-
tending tedious meetings, in ‘which
the only unifying element is a uni-
‘versal béhd of boredom, is: not the
most effective way of providing
“class. unity.”

Secondly, it doesn’t take a vote
in a meeting to make anyone
member of the class interested in
the inner workings of Self-Gov.,
A. A., Undergrad, and so .on.
Electing six members of the class
to an organization during- a -year
is not a” guarantee that any more
than six people are going to be-
come involved with that organiza-
tion. Also, . the.. freshmen have
shown a great deal of enthusiasm
in becoming involved in campus
activity without: the incentive of
a majority vote—witness the per-
centage of freshmen in the mem-
bership of the S.P.U..— or. the
freshman interest taken: in mate
ters like the self-gov. exam.

Lastly, electing several tem-
porary chairmen and songmistres-
sesso that class members may get
an idea of the capabilities of can-
didates is futile in that these tem-
porary officers hold only one class
meeting during their term—a meet-

ing to elect their successor. One

election meeting is_not_sufficient-to
show the inherent qualities of

leadership, etc. It also automatic- .

ally implies that the’-permanent
officers must be girls’ who’ were

temporary” officers—not ‘necessarily ~

true or desirable.
I would like to make the follow’
ingx suggestions for improvement. I

certainly don’t claim that these,

are the only -possible: basis for
correction i.e, anything would be
better than the way it’s being done
now):

A. Do away with the temporary

chairmen and ‘songniistresses én-
‘| tirely. Have two big meetings’ (run

by the junior class president) in
which freshmen who had expressed
an interest in running for office
(perhaps by: signing -up in the
halls) would speak briefly to the
class, giving past- experience, and
their reasons for running, Elec-
tions could then be held for per-

thereby saving: a lot of time, plus

insuring that. the class knows the.

“who and why” of the candidates.

- B. Only four reps from the ¢lass
should be elected to an organization
during the year, two at, the egin-.
ning, and sophomore reps in the

spring. They should only “be elected °

to the ipso facto organizations, “Other-
wise, freshmen should run as reps
from; their halls stone: with the
upperelag®men.

“ Perhaps a totaley diftonentt solu-
tion would be preferable—but I

submit.a. plea for badly needed. Tex.

In. Pauline Dubkin’s. review of
the Bryn\\Mawr-Haverford Revue,
she said, “the standard for creative
| work at these colleges is far below
that for academic production.” I
disagree. In academic communities,
‘the expression of creativity is not
limited solely to the art form, but
also exhibits itself in critical es-
says which can show as much
creatvity as.a poem or short. story.
Unfortunately, since The Revyué
does not publish literary essays,
no one car\ assess the . “creative
work at these colleges.” In all
fairness .to- Pauline’s review, she
did suggest the publication of cri-
tical essays, but I interpreted this

.|}as the expression 6f another unsub-

stantiated- preference.

Besides criticizing the low out-
put of creative energy, Pauline la-
mented the lack of “technical ab-
ility. needed to make such writing
live.” Since little of living litera-
ture dates back to the first two

outnOviginal controversial thegries- (Louis Fischer, for example) | Jecades_to any_author’s life, I won- |

are allowed to go unchallenged. ~Too-often- unorthodox points
of view (Maud Russell, for example) remain unquestioned.
Professors often criticize speakers.in class the day after the
lecture and students confine their discussion to the smoker.
Should not such criticism be aired in discussion at the lecture
where the speaker and others would have a chance to re-
spond? is se
Silence at the lecture implies either ignorance, timidity
or unqualified agreement—an impression often contradicted
by later reactions. The uninformed Should not hesitate to
ask. questions or express an opinion, while it is the responsi-
bility ‘of those. with knowledge in the field to challenge the
“speaker and to bring out other aspects of the issue. It would
' further seem-that here at Bryn Mawr it is mainly the pro-
+. fessors who must assume this responsibility. Too often in
” the past this has not been the case.""

We hope that in the future this situation will be reme-
died—that theories will be countered—that unsubstantiated
positions will be criticized—in short that speakers will not
be allowed to go unchallenged; and that students and’ faculty
will speak up. We hope that in the “War and Peace” panel
discussions this week a critical attitude will prevail and all
points of view will be voiced.

The winds have found the pickings rather lean.
We love to hear-our-eherry saplings blow, .

- During the past weekend we
journeyed to Mt. Holyoke, where we
were the well-treated Bryn Mawr
representatives at the annual Seven
College Conference. On Saturday
afternoon we were introduced at tea,
Our day. was spent in a discussion
of the philosophy.of student gov-
ernment. The Bryn Mawr partici-
pants were well-versed on these
abstract matters, as a result of the
recent “dinners”.

The smal] group discussions dur-
ing--supper .provided an opportun-
ity to approach individual people
on specific issues. We found that
several] campuses are-in a state of
flux. New forms’ of government are
being tried at these schools. Bar-
nard is attempting to break away
from its. class-oriented structure
and is putting more emphasis on
all-campus elected offices. Radcliffe
is also changing a previously class-
oriented system. They, however,
are trying to strengthen the. posi-
tion of the halls and hall reps.
Mt. Holyoke is beginning to re-
construct a system that has not
been changed in almost twenty
years. Vassar is just plain trying
to strengthen the student govern-
ment which has had -almost ‘no
voice in the recent past. Both Rad-
cliffe and Wellesley have instituted
his means
that the voting body consists of ad-
ministration and student represen-
tatives with equal power. |
‘Much of the evening conversa-
tion centered on defining the role
of the college in instituting and
enforcing moral standards. We at
Bryn Mawr have long considered
ourselves the. most liberal of the
seven sisters, but Radcliffe is: now
attempting to usurp our position:
Their representatives outlined their
“advances”, and’ were quite eager
to help the rest of us follow the
Radcliffe example. What. appears.
at first glance an extremely liberal
position reveals itself on closer ex-
amination to have several glaring
inconsistencies, Sign -outs which,
like ours, are required for safety’s
sake, seem unlikely to insure safe-

acceptable sign-out. A girl who
wishes to be out overnight must
confer with the head of residents;
whereas we merely ‘sign out. At
present these and other new rules
apply only to seniors. Next year
they will be extended to all but
freshmen. Any program such as
this would be contradictory to the
Bryn Mawr. practice of consider-

as those above them. This equal
treatment. becomes more - obvious
when we realize that we are the
only school, which does not re-
quire parental consent for fresh-
men’s: being away- overnight. .

One big concern among the other
colleges is the method of financing
clubs and organizations. Most
schools require that’ @ club be

Dear Editor:

Why hide Bryn Mawr’s talent?
Last week’s chorus concert showed
the least possible devlopment of the
ability of the two college choruses
—assumedly the purpose of having
a college chorus. As a backdrop for
professional singers the choruses
sauirmed from boredom and rarely
watched the conductor. They can
hardly be blamed for being impa-
tient for an hour’s worth of stand-
ing and ten minutes’ worth of sing-
ing.

The many assets of working with
professionals seems to be best and
fully accomplished by the unique
opportunity to work under Eugene
Ormandy once a year. Why can’t
the rest of the year be devoted to
programs in which the ability of our
own vocalists can be stretched?
Within a four-year period of this
kind of training the level of the po-
tential soloists within the college
would certainly be challenged, and
I believe it is a challenge our own
talent can meet and rise above.

What about student conductors?
The task of trying to be a conductor
might impress upon the students
more emphatically the importance
of a conductor and the need of watch-
ing him.

Bryn Mawr’s college chorus seems
to be an asset that is being ignored
and abused by inadequate challenge.

Senator Tower Gives Views

: Conservatives Seek ‘Maximuth Individual Liberty’

Senator John G. Tower (R-Tex.)
in a speech given last Thursday
defined a conservative as one who
welcomes change and, seeks pro-|
gress through existing institutions
and who desires that such progress
be made in a climate of maximum
individual liberty and free thought.
The conservative believes further-
more, that preservation of exist-
ing political and economic institu-
_tions— i.e. the. capitalist system—
is vital to preserving America’s
strong moral: fiber and superior
productivity. On more specific is-
sues, Sen. Towers favors relatively
low -but progressive taxation, low
government spending (because’ de-
pendance upon the government
breeds weakness in the individual),
- equality before the law. and of the
ballot box. All these views are con-
’ junctive with Sen. Tower’s belief
that, “The function of the govern-
-ment is to: preserve erder in so-
ciety, ‘but not to order society.”

Henkin Analyzes
- Logic In Numbers

Jennifer Ashworth,
-Graduate Student

: Otuaaor Leon ‘A. Henkin began

‘his lecture on “Mathematical Log-
ic: a Survey,” by sketching the his-
tory of mathematical logie;-which
has only developed —as—a specifies,
discipline within the last hundred
years. He said that .although*® ma-
- thematicians’ had always uncon-
sciously uséd logical rules of in-
ference in. their theorems, they did
not explicitly examine these rules
until the latter half of the nine-
teenth century, when an English-
~“man, Boole; noticed that rules of
logic could be expressed by alge-
braic symbols. A’ real investiga-
tion. of. what we. mean.by..a valid
proof was inspired by the paradox
arising from ‘C€antor’s seemingly
‘watertight proof that.there is a
largest infinite number, and Burali-
Forti’s~ equally —convincing ~ proof
that there is no largest infinite
number. Boolian symbolization
proved to be a useful tool. in | this
examination.

By the end of the nineteenth
century. there were two possible
lines of development for mathema-
tical logic, in Zermelo’s attempt to
provide an axiomatic basis for
Cantor’s theory of sets, and in
Frege’s system of formal deduc-
tive logic. The letter proved to be
the most sicKanetul, for it. was
taken .up by Russell and White-
head, and popularized in their
Principia Mathematica.

After giving a description of the
nature of-formal logic, which draws
up idealized models of language,
consisting of a list of symbols, for-
mation rules, a list of. axioms, ‘and
formal rules of inference by which
theorems can be derived from the
axioms, Professor Henkin went’on
to discuss two of the questions
which have bothered logicians in
the last forty years,

The first problem he examined"
,,
cn1962-05-09.txt,"['To the Editor:', 'Letter to the Editor:', 'Letters to ) the Editor ']","-

It Ne ecessary

To Clarify Tower’ s Opinions —

advocating ‘of political systems which —
differ from thé cane pronounds, _ me
Yet his proposals for the opposition
of ‘leftist’ gruops within the United
States and for the attachment of po-

_ |littical ‘strings’ to foreign aid would

Jsuggest that he does not believe in
‘individual freedom of choice’ in that .
sense.” The Senator would be the
first to want freedom of choice in
all matters; he certainly would not
object to. any poliical system oppos-
ed to what he'believes in—as long as .
it does not force itself upon him and
the people he represents and- abro-
gate their freedom. Of course he
opposes “leftist” groups—we would
all like to have everybody in agree-
ment with us; but opposition is not
only inevitable, it is also good, for it
allows the very. freedom of choice
which Ellen Rothenberg fears is be-
ing endangered.

Foreign Aid

As. for our~aid:-moriey—we~surely
have the right to say how we’ will
dispose: of our own funds, We may
say what we think would be the best
use for the funds—the foreign coun-
tries are entirely free to disagree -
with us and reject our money. They
always have other countries (in-
cluding the U.S.S.R.) as well as the
World’ Bank to turn to—none of |
whom will give funds without’ some
reciprocal benefit either. But there
is no limitation of choice—there are
many-alternatives.to-our. policies and
our funds. (Remember, these coun-
tries .are_likély.toget.what—they
want. from us on their own terms,
as we have a strong interest in keep~
ing them out from under communist
influence and domination.)

The standard remark about’ the ~
selfish conservative “concern for
money alone was also made. I must
make the assurance that the conser-
vative intentions are as humanitar-
ian as the liberals’; the difference
is in the view. of what is best for Hu-.
man society—a large degree of free-
dom of movement, accompanied by
the responsibility, and: sometimes
hardship, that go with a great deal
of individual freedom; or security
for_ all the segments.of society, but -
the necessary degree of government
regimentation needed to provide this
security, The difference of opinion
comes from a difference in view-
points on man’s ability.

Against U. N.

It does not appear to me that Sen-
ator Tower’s statements on the U.N.
are inconsistent. ‘He is allin favor —
of an organization that will resolve
differences among world nations; but-.
he thinks that it-is not mere “differ- ©
ences” that are involved. In _ his
opinion, the: U.N. is not effective
enough - to cope with our disagree-
ment with a group that seeks to de-
stroy “our system and our values.
He maintains that we-are not able
to.coexist-in-peace with an organiza-
tion that is bound, by its very pol-
icies, to remove our freedom : of
choice from us. If the communist
system did not endanger our system,

it, then a U.N. would be. possible
and workable. Please note the use
of the terms“‘group” and “organiza-
tion” rather than “nation” to denote
those people that the Senator feels
we need to ‘guard against. It is not,

Russians or the Chinese or any
other national group per-se that he
warns against (as is implied in the

It seems to me that the shadent
who ‘reviewed Robert McKay’s talk
on Supreme Court issues was some-
what less honest about her biases
than was Mr. McKay. It should be
quite: obvious to any reader of her
article that Miss Rosenblum agrees
with the Court’s gecisions on school
segregation’ and reapportionment but
opposes the school prayer’ decision.

Whether or not the decisions are
“good” ones may be a matter of
opinion, but Miss Rosenblum chal-
lenges Mr. McKay -on two points
which are not at all matters of opin-
ion. First, she says that the consti-
tutionality of the Court’s school
prayer decision is to be doubted be-
cause of the widespread disagree-
ment about it. Not so. .Mr. McKay
pointed out that it js.a-peculiarity
of the American judicial system that
\the Supreme Court has the final say
as to what is and what is not the
law. Surely Miss Rosenblum would
not suggest that on the day before
Brown v. Board of Education was
decided; the ‘majority’ of the “toun-
try. favored school segregation, but
that on the day of the decision the
voters changed their rajnds. Or per-
haps she méans that school segrega-
tion was. against the law all along,
but that this was only recognized
in 1954.

Secondly, Miss. Rosenblurn — asks,
“Is [Mr. McKay] suggesting that
the Court decide a case on the basis
of the implications of its decision, |:
rather than on the basis of the mer-
its of the case itself?” Let me re-
mind her that .cases are decided in
large part on. principles, and that
principles-‘are--supposd tebe - appli-
cable in more than. one. case... It.is}.
therefore only. sensible to ‘attempt
to discover-whether or not a prin-
ciple is a just one by asking whether
justice would result from its’ appli-
cation in cases other than the one
at hand; (For example, it was stat-
ed in the decision which the recent
reapportionment décision reversed

If all this sounds.a bit hard-head-
ed, it is perhaps because I agree with
the decisions discussed by Mr. Mc-
Kay. It is not supposed to mean
that. Supreme Court. decisions nec-
essarily result in justice, but it does
mean that these decisions are the
law and -can be changed only by
other decisions of the Court or by
constitutional amendment.

that which is innately negative, are
they:-not. offering positive. steps? :

To the Editor:

Though it may. be~ true that ee

newspaper editor. represents no. one
in particular and is responsible’ to
no-one when she writes an editorial,
it would seem to me that supporting
Clark-Dilworth in last week’s News
was “nota--wise: policy.~ I think the
editor may realize that the free-
enterprise system is still in force (in
spite of Senator. Clark’s past_efforts -
to. the contrary).
tinue to print -politically partisan
editorials, she may suddenly come
up with-a-set.of. politically’ partisan
subscribers, If this is not undesir-
able, by all means continue to sup-
port the Democratic candidates. How-,
ever, I understand that the Néws is”
not an affluent organization, and

without Republican subscriptions, it

might be a non-existent one. I. cer-
tainly feel. no constraint to Snasthial-
ly ‘support. an enterprise that is in
direct conflict with my political phi-
losophy.

Political editorializing is giving un-~ ~~"" >

thing which should be repugnant. to
any tolerant person on this canipus,
no matter whom she — in pol-
ities.

- A rathér interesting statement in :

the editorial: “William Séranton ...

course of the action.

If Newley’s. performance is weak-

excellent. She has realized, *in her
gestures and accents, the full comic
potential of her lines.

around one character. Per-

However, a more troubling defect
of Stop the. World is its shift in point
of view between the overlong first

act and the second. Though there

are many jabs at money values and
success drives made in the ‘first act,
the tone is generally. light. - Too
light, in-fact, to prepare us-for the

profoundly remorseful and bitter re-

Though there are some real faults
in Stop the World, it is on he
whole a very charming. and imagin-

life threatens to depress or annoy

him, he ‘holds up his ‘hand and yells
“Stop the World.” It stops, and

‘he ambles easily over -to the corner,

where he tells. jokes, makes remarks
upon the action of the play, and steps
out of the circus of his life for’a few
moments: to become the ringmaster.

the paucity of letters this week indicates again how Bryn
Mawrters do not use such opportunities to the fullest. —

Logically speaking, there are only three choices of what

to do with the editorial column; ~We could have no editorials,

we could return to having. dull, uncontroversial, editorials

_ about the weather ahd-the unpopular food-in the halls; or we

can speak our minds on issues of importance to us as college

students and as human beings, urging our readers not nec-|.
essarily to accept our point of view\but to consider it, to ques-|.

tion it, to respond to it. If we did not choose the third alter-
native, we would not only be failing in our duty to stimulate
a give and take discussion but we would be producing a dull,
boring, blah paper—and we know from experience that Bryn

National Science Foundation Acts seem to us
hollow victory.

~The oath is gone. But in-substance the new restrictions.

-are more severe. Under the old law, in order to receive money

that had been awarded, the student had to sign a statement
denying support of any subversive organization. Now just
signing one’s namie to an application achieves the sare pur-
pose with the added penalty of five years in jail or a $10,000

fine for applying if one is ineligible for politig

reasons.

_ Those of us who objected to the original ‘act cannot help
but revoice our objections after the recent Congressional

changes.

Furthermore, we cannot see how President Ken-

nedy could-have-signed the new bill with such pleasure. unless

ciples involved.

~—~~""The new act, lik

‘earding the disclaimer oath than he did

mosphere in which the student’ is afraid to-speak his mind
or sign his name because his. opinions and his actions may

'. return to haunt him when he seeks academic advancement..

creases this féar. cae
n all our investigations into the (Congressional Record, |.
ressional..Quarterly-and.an-assortment.-of-books.and

government pamphlets we have been unable to find precise

answers.

Many: questions remain: What. organizations are

presently considered ‘subversive’? Are the organizations
involved the ones on the famed. “Attorney. General’s list’ ?

If an

nization is a Communist front group but a student

who-joins is ignorant of its connections with the Communist
Party, ishe still guilty of membership in a subversive orga-

nization?

Membership

in a subversive organization is defined in

the McCarran Act as ‘support’, the giving of “money. or any
other-thing of value.” Is attending one meeting out of curi-
osity support? Is signing a petition support? Is writing.an
editorial support? Is demonstrating support? Is believing in
some of ‘the same principles support? Is working. jointly with

“subversives” ‘to further*other, not necessarily anti-demo-

ctatic aims considered support? We do fot-know. And the
reaction of most people who do not know is to keep silent
and not to exercise their freedom of press, speech and orga-

nization.

We wonde

r why a provision:to inspect a student’s ‘crim-
_inal record was added? The personality indications one could
-draw from a list of speeding tickets is probably not very

great. But what-effect will a student’s having spent. time.in
jail as a result of.civil rights disobedience (sit-ins or refusal
to- take part: in an air-raid drill) have on those awarding the

funds?

We canndt help feeling t

hat the new N.D.E.A. does ‘not

differ in essencte’from the old act, in that both seek to regu-

most casual touch makes him hys-
terical. ‘ =
From the beginning, he and
Lisa are drawn together. She is

unable to communicate,: and when
‘she does speak, it is in rhyme. But

instead of responding, she takes
another identity, and vents her
hostility in furious stomping. and
violent rhymes:

The ~ relationship is begun. by

Lisa; and it is she who until. the.

climax shows the greatest benefit
from it. Supported by David’s cold-

is gradually» able to recognize her
own identity as acceptable.

But it is not until David unthink-

The issue raised in the February
15 edition of the News on the desire
for extended library hours has awak-
ened quite a bit of comment. The
original article chose to emphasize
that the cost of keeping the’ build-
ing open for these additional hours
was a major factor and that this-cost
had been found to be virtually neg-
ligible. o
, One ofthe purposes of Miss Wal-
ker’s rebuttal (February 29) was
to show that the safety factors in-
volved, the reserve rooms unprotect-

= ed and lacking any communication

with the outside, would demand the
employment..of. watchmen at both
ends of the Library. While ngt an
overwhelming financial problem, it
is on a somewhat higher scale than
the cost of heat and light, the main
considerations in the original article.,
Her second point was whether such:
extended hours were indeed neces-
sary. cus
The replies to these observations
in the last issue of the News*(March'™
6) have raised three points: 1. that
student conscientiousness and self-
discipline have been impugned)» 2.
that there is*indeed a problem with
reserve books; and 3. that the stu-
ts were being urged to follow a
foolish and unreasonable tradition.
1, would. like -first. to say that
I feel we have been unusually fortu-
nate this year in the undergradu-
ates manning the reserve desks dur-
ing regular hours. Even so, there
have still been many occasions when
the person responsible has failed to
show up and the librarians have had
to scout around to find a fill-in or
do without this help.. |
The atttitude at Bryn Mawr ap- .
pears to be (and I do not at all dis-
agree) that the student is-here- pri-
marily for her education and that -
other commitments. must go by ¢he
board’ when academic. pressures
mount. The, result, is thatthe Li-
brary ‘is léft unmanned, often at the:
most critical moments. I say this
with ful] appreciation of the stu-
dents’ probiems, but it does not less-""

Pick two students at random on

this campus: and ask them to debate. -

onthe financial situation, of. any
student-run activity; most likely
neither will be able to. This finan-

__vial ignorance is, due not only to a

lack of interest but also to the great
scarcity of publicized facts.
The Bryn Mawr student body has

- been’ given the privilege of manag-

ing its own organizations.- At. the
meetings of every organization, the
executive and judicial powers are

discussed and their minutes~ posted~

—not so’ for monetary matters.
, Detailed financial reports” are

rarely made. The student body hears
nothing unless by rumors, and’ these

are generally: rumors of doubt. Even _

at election times when the organi-
zation heads come to the halls, they

are able to give only vague replies —

to questions concerning their finan-.
cial status, i.e., their initial funds,
expénditures and: -eurrent balances.

This uncertainty is not so much
‘the fault of the individuals as the

superiority of Bryn Mawr students,
I do not think that even they ‘are

totally immune from the common .-

weakness of leaving required read-
ing until the last minute. I am quite
sure that, with any advance know-
ledge of a genuine need, the Library
will make every~ effort to secyre
added copies.’ And if the studénts
themselves note real shortages of

ful to be alerted to the situation.

8:
a complete misunderstanding of the
original statement. The quote is
. one has chosen four years of
college and: in so doing has commit-,
ted oneself to a pattern of life for
those years.” ‘The “pattern” here
does not, 1 think, mean tradition,
but the way in which one adjusts
one’s life to..a—particular situation.

The lines imply to me simply that
one cannot eat one’s'cake and have
it, that one cannot commit oneself
to an exacting academic regime and
still “enjoy all the social pleasures
that. a less arduous schedule might
permit.. I am not prepared to com-
ment here, on whether this position
is truly applicable to this situation
since. it seems to me a highly sub-
‘jective interpretation. I am merely.
trying to set the record straight.

SUGGESTIONS

We. therefore suggest that:
(1) The College News should in-

‘vestigate their publication, adver-

tising, and subscription policies;
- (2) Business Managers and Trea-
gurers should keep their advisors and

“committees well informed in their

(3) A final report*on the expen-

the end of the year;

cerning the orders of blazers, lan-

because ‘too’ often companies have
established monopolies. .

reassessment of student-run finances
is of primary importance of we are

Workshop, | Gciubert
Highlight Sojourn
Of Eastman Group .

by Nina Jean Greenberg :

The straightforward. and lucid
playing of the Eastman String Quar-
tet_ resulted in an enjoyable concert
Tuesday evening, in Goodhart Hall.

. Presented by the Friends of Music,

the Quartet, whose members~- are
Joseph Knitzer and. John’ Celetano,
violins, Francis Bundra, viola, and
Georges Miquelle, violoncello, gave
a program of music, by Beethoven,
Debussy, and Dvorak.
‘The opening work, the Quartet
in G Major, Op. 18,.No. 2 is a rath-
er early work of Beethoven’ and pre-
cedes shortly the First Symphony,
which still shows clearly the. influ-
ence of Mozart. The piece was. play-
ed lightly and with restraint. -The
next work, Claude Debussy’s Quar-
tet in G Minor, Op. 10, was compos-
ed in 1893, when Debussy was 81. °
Its ‘initial reception was far-from
favorable and was hampered by the

-fact that-the musicians. who per-

formed it, did not’ understand the
music and were recalcitrant. about
rehearsing it. The quartet is. built
ori a cyclic theme~and-encompasses
a different range of expression from
that of the Beethoven, in that it is
less formal and explores the realm ~
The second move-

cept, the viola are playing a light
pizzicato figure, and the third move-
ment, which is started by soft second
violin and vidla entrances, were”

‘played with exquisite taste.

The pregram ended with the

~ Quartet in E-Flat, Op, 51, by Dvor-

4k, which was written in 1875, when
the composer was 87 and fourteen.
years before he came to America. It
is of a Slavonic character’and- closes
with the. forni of a Czech- dance.
The group then played as an encore
the finals from Boccherini’s Quartet
in A Major, No. 8.

As Mr. Celetano stated. during
the workshop given earlier on Tues-:
day, the Quartet tries to produce a
homogeneous sound, swhereby each
ofits members must modify his li-
brato, dynamic sound, and. intona-
tion to some extent. Their perfor-
mance showed a cognizance of these
factors, and the refinement with

-which each instrumentalist played |

meyealed the. individuality within
conformity that’ makes* good en- ~~
semble playing. : —

Artist s Role Today at 1963 Response

_ by .Elizabeth ‘Greene

The 1963 Response, «held from ise

April 19 to April 21 at. Princeton,
featured writers, musicians, art-
ists, archite¢ts and executives in.a
discussion of “The Artist in an
. Industrial Society.”

‘The conference opened with Ar-

_nold Gingrich moderating a panel :
au- (
of Who’s Afraid of Virginia °

‘ composed of Edward Albee,
thor
Woolf, Bernard Malamud, author

‘instance, an electric

of The Assistant, and Robert .Penn .

Warren, author of All the King’s
Men and, with Cleanth Brooks, co-
- founder of the New, Criticism.

Mr: Malamud said, that critics
complained that the modern novel
was too concerned with the tyran-
ny of symbolism and not enough
‘concerned with, social problems.

He stressed that the important aim
of a-novel was to Panties. “intri=~
-eate and mysterious man.’

TECHNIQUE

He added that, although the SP
ject matter of a novel may be
personal, the novelcan, and prob-
ably will, reflect the society. As to
the form, of modern novels, “A
modern writer will use any ‘tech-
nique to get feeling,” he coneluded.

‘“He’s got my gospel,” ’ Robert
Penn Warren began. He added
“Trony ‘has laid the tissue’ of our
time.” As for modern. society, :
“Man seems to be living in an
anti-society. He denies the sense
of identity granted by the union
with other- men and.with nature.

“In modern art, the will to style
led to obscurity ‘and alienated art
from society. Modern poets are
@xquisitely -concdrned~~-with their
‘ personal fate, but if it is art, liter-

- ature looks outside and.creates a
world; bs looks inside and creates
a man.’

“T ean only: talk “to you about
the. pursuit of literary excellence
in a dictatorship—I mean a dem-
“eracy,” said ‘Edward Albee, the
‘third panelist. “It is the mindless

~ hierarchy-of the theater, beginning
with the owner-of the theater, the
“chief aesthetician in, the United .

He concluded with an appeal to
the audience to demahd good

in: gratitude to
Constance M. K. Applebee
_for many years
Director of Physical Education
at Bryn Mawr College
and to
Mary Warren Taylor
her friend and associate.”

In spite of a plaque over the Ap-.

plebee Barn fireplace many “Bryn
Mawrters don’t know: who Miss Ap-
plebee -is. or why. our barn’, was
named for her. Constance Applebee,
who: came from England to this

country in 1901, brought to us her

favorite sport, field hockey. Since

_then she has worked very. hard to fthe Physical
“promote the ‘game in her adopted

country.

Miss Applebee, whe will be nine-
ty in June, came here to attend the
Harvard University summer ses-
sion. While at-Harvard-she-beeame
involved in a game of “Going to
Jerusalem.” She didn’t like the
game at all. She looked around un-
til she saw an interesting person

whom she could. follow..out of ‘the.

room. When they» had left the
room, the lady whom Miss Applebee
had chosen to follow asked if they
played such games ‘in England, She

«“Applebee to

replied’ that they didnot.
played field hockey.
- As a-result of

They

is conversation,

Miss Applebeé cdllected and con-

cocted ‘equipment ‘until she could
present. a demonstration. of -field
hockey at Harvard... The woman
who ‘had left. “Going To Jerusa-
lem” with her, saw ‘the demon-
stration and since she was:connect-
ed with Vassar College asked Miss
“demonstrate the
game there. That fall Miss Appie-
bee introduced field hockey to
Vassar, Smith, Mount
Wellesley. and to Bryn Mawr.

In 1905 she became the head .of
Education . depart-
ment here, where she remained
until 1927. In 1922 Miss Applebee
organized the. United States Field
Hockey Association, -And hockey
clubs inspired by her have been es-
tablighed__all._ across .the country.
She “opened the Poconos Field
Hockey Camp. The camp” was
planned to help both players and

teachers of field hockey sinee
there were few. Americans with
any experience in téaching the

game. Many..secondary school and

BMC-Haverford Art Show
Displays Skill, Originality

.. by. Constance Rosenblum

As.a part of the Parents Day. fes-

tivities, a Bryn. Mawr-Haverford
Student-Faculty Art Show opened
in the Roost on Saturday.

The collection, sponsored by Arts
Council, is far more colorful and
varied than the first student exhibi-
tion, including works in a wide va-

“riety of media—woodcuts, etchings,

*

on eS
eatiicine

pen and ink drawings, Warerenlore,
oils.

The most impressive works ex-
hibited are a series of nine black
and white paintings by Fritz: Jans-
chka, abstract illustrations for
“American Nights” by Richmond
Lattimore. Arranged in ‘columns of
two and giving the impression of
the pages of a book, the paintings do
not merely illustrate Mr. Lattimore’s

Seated sahbeater. it. demands. and. deseryes.”’ ee poems;- but rather. they. capture. the.
- in “The. Inner -

essence and spirit of the: poems.

The bold, almost primitive —paint-
ings seem able to interpret not only
the concrete images in Mr. Latti-
more’s poems, but the highly ab+
stract ones as well. “Knee deep in
froth of. daisies and the night”
suggested to Mr. Janschka a’ few
rough stars; surrounded. by broad
circles,
of “daisy+ness” as precisely © ag any

~Titeral “drawing of-a- -daisy- would,

“This ribbon world of nerves, driy-

ing forever driving in a dream” is”
captured by. a few indications “of-

axles juxtaposed on circles; and even:
with: such intangible and~ abstract
words” as “ip me.-and no. one else

the world is grown” the feeling’ of

the ‘words are caught, in this case
with: an indication. ofthe delicate,
tear-like center of a bleeding- heart.

Other~ outstanding “work in the

exhibition “is “done ~by~ Jane~--Rese:—--

“My Father, Working on the Tele-
vision Camera,” was highly.abstract;
nevertheless, in the blue-gray cloth-
wire-plaster arms and-curves of both
pieces there was muchrdluidity and a
rhythmic balance of..forms.

Jane’s vaintings, especially “Sev-
en A.M. Forty-seventh Street” and
“Vistas of The Four Day Week” are

_executed_with a “feathery”. and.del-

icate use of medga, so that the
slightly rough texture of the draw-
ings was as important as the colors
themselves.

Joanne Wilson’s works, primarily
“The Fervid Wheels” and “The In-
ner Ear” ere executed with more
boldness and roughness, In )“The
Fervid ‘Wheels” large patches of
white paper were left uncolored, ‘and
Ear” paint:. was
splashed and spattered against the’

more carefully: outlined .gray ane fal

There is great “contrast in the
exhibition. Other works range from

delicate etchings—a» tumbling Pier-.

the ‘boldly ‘colored head by Dov,
(Bernard Lederberg), .

also,

While’ Miss Applebee was. at
Bryn. Mawr, field ‘hockey was the
only fall sport’ offered and all the
students belénged to a hockey
team. Miss: Wyckoff: of the Geology:
Department and Miss Woodworth
who is'now a professor of English
played on Miss Applebee’s teams
when they -were aye Mawr under-
graduates... ; fee carn rer

Miss’ Applebee was also inter-
ested in Bryn Mawr off the hockey’
field. She instigated the Y.W.C.A.
movement on our campus which
has. developed -into our Interfaith.
She felt the students should be able
to- express ‘their own views and
helped, them establish the Sane?
News.

. Perhaps. one of the most im-
portant. and unusual things about
Miss Applebee is that she has not .:
only, been successful’ in eStablish-
‘ing hockey herein the United
States, but has been privileged. to
see the success of her efforts. As’a
result -of her work, the United
States has been host.to an inter-
national field’ hockey conference
twice in the past and will. be again

in September. Representatives

from twenty nations will meet on
the Goucher

Wednesday, May 1, 1963,

May Day

witnessed by a “crowd of
appareled spectators.” -

‘

gayly .

May Pole dancing followed. af-..-

ter .the crowning of the May
Queen, and then graduate students
and alumnae presented four Eli;
zabethan plays, Each undergradu-
ate class also contributed a play
‘to the pageant. It began at “3
Hours after Noone”, and closed
two and a half hours later with
an old English supper of “brothe,
capon in, gelye, sallet of chykenys,
cruste rolle, jamme’ tartes, straw-

berries served with creme, and ‘~

cakys.”
It was défficult to reconcile -the
traditional May, Day costumes

dress. Controversy over ; whether

. girls’ should wear men’s clothing in
public. was. resolved... by-..covering

them up ‘with smocks and’ cloaks.
The costumes were passed by
a costuming committee, yet the
farmer who brought his oxen from
Lancaster exclaimed, “Never again
will TAllow my oxen to see such a:

‘sight as this.”

One of the difficult tasks of the
first .May Day. pageant was to

organize the Elizabethan music. ~

When union musicians went ‘on

strike against..the long Wours-of-
the Elizabethan revels, the music

clubs of “Haverford averted disas-~
ter by donning costumes and pro-

viding the music.

President M. Carey Thomas, in
her May Day speech in 1915, told
the students, “Your May Day re-
vels were the first of the many re-
vivals of this old custom.” Origin-
ally a Roman festival of spring,

of May Day marked the coming
of summer with games, revels,
worship of Beowulf and*- other
heroes of myth and saga.

In 1906, six. months of prepara-

tion-were-devoted- to—the-pageant, =

and Masqués were first presented

in. the. newly-completed Cloisters.

Cornelia Otis ‘Skinner made her
debut in the 1910 May Day as
Moth.in A Midsummer Night's
Dream, and appeared again in 1920
as Sacrapant in The Old Wives’
Tale.

_ In 1925, a News article cited as
the most*praiseworthy character-
istic of May Day “a delightful
Anglo-Saxon rowdiness.”. “Too of-
ten is this missing from our plight-

‘ed, intellectual -youth!”

But the 19386 pageant, the last
Big May Day to be held, was far
greater in scope than any previous
celebration. Preparations were be-
gun in February, but the director
assured students that they would
not have to give up-any of their
spring vacation.

Every undergraduate participa--
ted in the dancing, and the grand-
stands reached the third. floor of.
Taylor: Two novelties, strolling play-
ers and wagon -plays, were both
features. of . Elizabethan. drama.
The acquisition of four white oxen
from Maryland and Virginia was
called “a triumph for the 1986 May
Day.” Miss Ethel Grant, instructor
in~ physical-education at Bryn

- the medieval Teutonic celebration —

Mawr, who taught, the dancers for’

_ the..1932 and 1986 May Days, ad,

- too’ much,” but

they. just had to

“The ‘tremendous effort involved ~—

was in fact one of the main rea-

Day celebration. “It was just get-

Grant. “Also, it didn’t seem like

Last February, the UnitedStates

editorials calling for obedience to
federal law in Alabama. The edi-
torials appeared during and after ©

me,’? Meyer said, ‘‘is that this

Such a ban is an infringement

He spoke’ of national

. MYre. Rezelman contended that
the. Negro, like any other minority
group in America, has‘no altern-
ative .but to be assimilated into
the. mainstream: of American So-
ciety. He looks on this condition

as a reflection.of;American his- —

torical development. In South Af-
rica the situation is not equiva-
lent. The white population. is: not
an overwhelming majority and the
Bantu nations are. not unified by
a common historical background,
‘The » several different. Negroid
races are divided by dialect and
customs, Mr. Rezelman is con-
vinced that the nationalistic senti-
ment sweeping the continent has
destroyed any desire for the South
African Negroes to share equal-
ity with the white population: hav-
ing once . attained the power to
do so, the Negroes would be anx-

In the interest of the college
community, I would like to call
attention to adistressing situation.
It centers, as does much on this
campus, on the library.

A good friend of mine and I
headed for the library Thursday
night with the admirable intentions
of studying. As we entered the
door, one of the librarians accosted
us and demanded my escort’s cre-
dentials. No, he was not a student
at Bryn Mawr. Well, then, he
could NOT use the _ library
facilities. Only with a letter of
introduction from his school could
he have the privilege. This policy,
which she said has long been in
effect applies whether the guest
wishes to borrow books or not.
Thus we were thrust from the
library. I shiver in contemplation
of the approaching winter. The
Man hole covers - the warmest
- are not too
conducive to study.)

I protest! The rule in question
is nowhere in print, not even
in an obscure footnote of the yellow
pages of M, Carey Thomas Library
rules, Further, I am amazedatthe
means enployed to execute this un-
official policy. The upholding of

Toynbee to Teach

SARASOTA, Fla. (CPS)--- The
New College, an experimenta!
school with aa 1l1-month yearand
three-year degree program, has
announced its first faculty mem-
ber, Dr. Arnold Toynbee, the Eng-
lish historian,

The college will open nex: fall
with 190 students who will receive
classical educations in the
huma.iities and sciences, Teaching
will be by seminar aid tie tutorial

New College, which is plaaned
to give ‘‘personal education of a
limited numter of highly moti-
vated and capable students,’’ will
be private and eo2ducational,

the reputation of the college a
concept embodied in that ex-
pressive dictum, the ‘‘discredit
clause,’? depends on the of-
ficialdom: of Bryn Mawr as well
as on the student body.

While there may be a problem
with unescorted males in the
library, I should think there would
be no question of the welcome of a
guest accompanied bya Bryn Mawr
girl.

The problems of library ad-
ministration will best be solved
through courtesy and cooperation.

NVS.A. Representation Worth It?

""Defin itely” Ellen Gross States -

Should there be an: mh rep on
campus?

This question, which is presently
facing Bryn Mawr, as well asa
number of other institutions, is dif-
ficult to answer, Not only is its
function a dubious one to a number
of the members of the college, but,
in addition, its organization is

complicated by the inefficiency of
-.the. National.Commission, as ¢x- -

plained in last week’s COLLEGE
NEWS.

. However, Ellen Gross, president
of Self Gov, urged its support,
“despite present weaknesses, be-
cause its potentiality is not com-
pletely fulfilled at this moment.’’

It is not a completely represen-
tative organization at this time, she
explained, For example, many
southern schools do not belong to
NSA because it supports the court’s
decision on integration,

However, although NSA is basi-
cally a: liberal organization, ‘‘it is
not run so that the conservative
position is never expressed,”

‘ Ellen explained, Q

. “NSA is weak,’’ she continued,
‘not only because of the unrepre-
sentational membership, but also

_ because many, ‘many campuses do

not take fullest advantage of NSA,

_for exdmple, by bringing NSA-

For NSA Cut

In Revised Undergrad Budget

- The remaining parts of the Com-
mon Treasury budget were passed
Monday night .at. the Undergrad —
meeting. There was debate on
several items, resulting in a re-
duction of budgets for NSA, and:
College Inn improvement.

Students first objected to the
proposed budget of $921 for NSA
on the grounds that the amount
was disproportionate to other or-
ganization budgets and to NSA’s
role on campus.

The ensuing item-by-item de-
bate on the budget, however, re-
vealed only five places where it
was felt the budget could be cut,
and a total reduction of $180 was
finally voted.

The cuts were ntade in the fol-
lowing items:

(1) -The’ conference allotment,
which could enable NSA to send
students (at half fare) to the Re-

We think that the present system

of scheduling exams at Bryn Mawr
creates unnecessary problems for
many students.

Because exams dates are arbi-

utilize their time to best advan-

unduly pressured for time to study,

one wing of Erdman which will be
fairly well isolated from the rest

have two small dining rooms in .
addition to the large one, so it
might be possible for the Russian
students ,to eat in seclusion. .Other.

possible locations include the'three.

present language houses if inter-
est in one of them declines. One
.wing of Denbigh was also men-
tioned- as- a~- possibility, but--the
idea was dropped because of the
expected reaction of Denbigh re-
sidents,

Russian Club President Sandy
Shapiro says that a Russian house
is especially necessary because
there is little opportunity to go to

‘the Soviet Union or to speak Rus-

sian anywhere else,

Russian Club is also hoping to
start ‘a .Russian table this year.
Since twenty-three people have
said they want to sit at it, there
may have to be morethan one table
to accommodate them, Professors
will be. invited to dinner at the
Russian table,. which may be in
Denbigh.

“Young Democrats”
To Be Revitalized

The Young Democrats on the
Bryn Mawr campus have been far
from active this year. In fact the
‘¢club’’ now consists of a presi-

»,dent . and only a few would-be
- members. It may be hard to believe

that ona ‘‘liberal’’ college campus, --
one where the Young Republicans
claim that they cannot finda faculty
sponsor, the Young Democrats
have remained virtually inactive.
Steps are now being taken, how-
ever, to revitalize the club: a
membership drive will soon be
under way, panel discussions about
the upcoming Presidential and
Vice-Presidential nominations are
planned, and tentative plans for
campaign work in the ~ are bron

formulated, -

The Young Democrats hope to
‘Offer “liberals’’ an opportunity/to
exchange ideas and to gain prac-
tical field experience in politics. .
The club also hopes to be able to
plan joint activities with the Young
Republicans, Suggestions will be
appreciated. Anyone interested
should contact Nancy Kuhn, Presi-

dent, in Wyndham.

We are puzzled by some of her.
critical terms. What, for example,
does “balance of tonal quality’’ .

mean? Do you refer to the re-

We were amused at her choice
of words, i.e., ‘‘appropriate gusto”’
in discussing the performance. of
a magnificat. We don’t understand

how the word ‘“‘pedantic’’ applies -

to interpretation and performance.
The. few.. instances --of--objective

and meaningless. We think — her
method of reviewing is bold for

someone who lacks a precise vo- _

feel that they must praise it un-

To the Editor:

Sin¢e Miss Wilber’ is not a
Freshman, she overlooked certain
facts in her letter of-6 March 1964

‘ about the few students of the Class

of 1967 who were not given letters
of introduction to enable them to
use another jibrary. These facts
are: that the students had not suf-

ficiently explored the material in —

Bryn Mawr’s collection; that some
books were ‘out’; that no mention
was made that any of the students
were taking advanced courses.
There is also some doubt that

any of the students. given the reas=

on for refusal exactly as quoted,
However, it is recognized that a

~research library, such as is Bryn

.Mawr’s,has most of the books which
first year students need.

A more disturbing angle of. the
letter ts ignoring entirely the

__ Guest Soloists, Joint Chsnsiaise Lauded |
_ Fer-Performance In ‘St. lokn Passion.

If anyone has ever doubted that
a large chorus could sing’Bach’s
St. John Passion, Saturday night’s
performance proved them wrong.

Perhaps the most brilliant as-
pect of the concert was the quick
__ Tesponse ofthe Bryn Mawr-Haver-
ford Chorus to Mr. William
ReeSe’s ‘ condicting.. Moreover,
Mr. Goodale deserves great praise
for his excellent p ration of the
. Bryn Mawr Chorus. . ,

In the final chorale in Part I,
it was truly amazing to see Mr.
Reese ask for more power in the
words .‘*Peter while his conscience

‘William Reese conducts the Schutz

syept, /Thrice denied his -Savior’’
and \to hear the immediate up-
surge of voices, which softened
to “piano” on the words ‘When
qj evil I am _ set,/Through my
conscience reach me,”

This peak of excellence. was:
immediately surpassed in the
opening Chorale of part I, The
full chorus entered as a single
voice on the words ‘Christ who
knew. no. sin of wrong’’ with such
accuracy of diction, phrasing and
sheer power that no one could
have missed the’ import of the
words, '

How Mr. Reese trained so many
voices to sing the words ‘‘Scoffed
at, scorned and spat upon’’ in a
vibrant staccato leaves one truly
baffled!

The clear fugal entrances of
the Schiitz Group (on stage) were

‘equally as brilliant in execution,

This. Group was: by no means
small, as it was often joined by
the New Choral Society, Yet one

could hear each part pick: up the —

phrase “Do not rend it or divide
it’? and carry it through smooth-
ly. and accurately,

To me the section | will long
remember was ‘‘Not this Man,
No not Him, -Give us Barabus.’’
In rehearsals, I had seen Mr.
Reese working to bring this sec-

tion to perfection. The syncopation:

of this musical phrase itself was

_intricate, yet when the performance

came, not one voice faltered!

Dinner Plan to Raise Funds
For Voter Registration Drives’

By Mary Thom,,. ‘66
and Ginny Kerr ’66

Vital to the attainment of social
justice inthe South is the exercising
the right to vote, The- current
drive on the Bryn Mawr and Haver-
ford campuses is to raise funds in
support of SNCC’s voter registra-
tion activities.

Many southern’ states require
that citizens pass stringent literacy
tests before they are accorded the

~privilege “of. registering. to vote.

In Mississippi applications filled
out by Negroes that are otherwise
correct are often disqualified for

.» minor errors such as improper
capitalization, ues

Many Negroes are discouraged
from even attempting to register
by organizations such as the White
Citizens’ Council, which describes
the Supreme Court’s school in-
tegration decision of May 17, 1954,
‘ta patent perversion of \the Con-
stitution, based on false ‘science’.”’

‘Workers for various organiza-
tions, particularly SNCC, are hold-
ing registration classes to instruct
Negroes in writing, grammar, and
interpreting federal and state con-
stitutions, and to encourage Negro
registration in the South by making
them aware of their constitutional
rights and the Federal protection
due them.. Many of the workers

We have exciting new plans such!

Tougaloo
To The Editor:

Monday, May 4, at 9:45 p.m., in
the Roost, Undergrad will discuss
a letter received from NSA, con-
cerning the proposed revocation of
the charter of Tougaloo University.

The pending bill before the Mis-
Sissippi Legislature evidentiy will
be passed unless pressure of some
sort can be exerted onthe lawmak-
ers and the governor.

Tougaloo has been actively in-
volved in the civil rights movement
in the South, and has been respon-
sible for civil disturbances. How-
ever, the closing of a University
does not seem to be a legitimate
way to counteract these distur-
bances. On these grounds, Bryn
Mawr could have been closed in
the 1900’s for having Suffragettes
who were responsible for riots.

Undergrad hopes to pass areso-
lution supporting the University,
which will be sent to legislators
and the governor.

Such a resolution is not expect-
ed to be very effective. However,
it is the only contribution we can
make at this time.

A more effective stand could be
made by the Bryn Mawr faculty and
by the National Federation of
Teachers,

The passage of this bill would
establish a dangerous precedent

and it is hoped that our faculty
are sufficiently concerned with
this threat to education to take
action. The National Federation
coula encourage Mississippi
teachers to threaten resignation,
in the event of the bill’s passage.
Perhaps the lawmakers would bet-
ter understand this kind of pres-
sure.

Sincerely,

Gill Bunshaft

and NSA representative

Schuetz Warblers

To The Editor;

With reference to your article
“Schuetz Warbling Wows Alum-
nae’’ (April 22), I felt that the mem-
bers of the Schuetz Group as well as
other Bryn Mawr and Haverford
‘friends of Schuetz’ would be inter-
ested in the following comments.
The first comes from the President
of the Bryn Mawr Clubof Washing-
ton, D.C., Mrs. Frank Hammond,
who writes:

*¢, eI cannot tell you how much
all our alumnae and guests en-
joyed your delightful concert!
Believe me--the combined group
--is a most successful ‘experi-
ment’--and the music was just
magnificent... You are wonder-
ful ‘public relations agents’ for
Bryn Mavwr...’’

The second comes from Eliza-
beth Reed (’62) who was in charge
of the Washington arrangements
for the Group:

**The Bryn Mawr Alumnae Club
was delighted with your Wash-
ington spring concert, and I am
happy to tell you that the Hein-
rich Schuetz Singers raised
more money for the local schol-
arship fund than any similar
group has done before. Congrat-
ulations on a job well done, and
we look forward to a future con-
cert...”

It is wonderful to be appreciated, -
and I hope that future members of
the Group will enjoy return trips
as much as we enjoyed this one.

Sincerely yours,

Anda Polyzoides

President of the Bryn Mawr-
Haverford Schuetz Group

Consideration?

To the Editor:

I am very much disturbed by
the thoughtless negligence of
people on this campus. What is
wrong when professed interest in
a given subject fails to carry
through to action? Why is it that
Bryn Mawrtyrs feel that they take
on no responsibility when their
expressed interests create a pro-
ject? Are they aware of the time
and effort which goes into plan-
ning activities on this campus?

The immediate cause of my
annoyance is the response to the
Interfaith-sponsored trip to the
Circle Mission of Father Divine
in Philadelphia. The trip was plan-
ned for Thursday evening, and
twenty-five names were signed
on the list in Taylor. On Thursday
two girls showed up at Pem Arch,
The other girls seem to have
forgotten or simply decided to
study, at the last moment.

Because of the interest shown,
I had asked two Haverfordians
to drive into Philadelphia, this
in addition to the student-driven
college station wagon. Three cars
were ready and waiting on Thurs-
day evening, driven by people will-
ing to sacrifice this time to take
twenty-five ‘‘interested’? Bryn
Mawr students to Philadelphia.

Can the point be clearer? Such
total lack of responsible action
hardly seems compatible with our
Status of intelligent, educated
young women - ‘leaders of our so-
ciety’? in the not-so-distant fut-
ure? Courtesy is an important
quality in anyone.

Undergrad opened last Monday

Arts Council Maps
Next Year’s Plans:
Tickets and Talent

Arts Council met Tuesday after-
noon to organize and outline its
program for next year, President
Diana Hamilton said that the plans
are centered around encouraging
the students both to participate in
Arts Council activities and to ex-
ploit their own talents.

New projects for the Council in-
clude a poster committee, compos-
ed of willing and able slaveysfrom
each hall; a Haverford-Bryn Mawr
calendar of events, (closer cooper-
ation and coordination between the
cultural and aesthetic elements of
both campuses will presumably
enrich each, and next year the
Haverford and Bryn Mawr Councils
hope to work together to greater
advantage); organized trips to pri-
vate collections in the area; and a
regular movie series ‘‘featuring
GOOD movies, Bogart, Chaplin,
maybe even Fellini.’’

An ‘tespecially exciting’’ inno-
vation next year will be a contest,
sponsored by Council and the Re-
view, for original one-act plays.
The winners will be directed in an
experimental presentation of, by,
and for students.

Arts Council will continue to
provide the symphony series in
September and tickets for various
events throughout the year, A tic-
ket commission will try to make
tickets more available by pooling
unused tickets and redistributing
them, Arts night will be produced
as usual, and a program of speak-
ers will be maintained with em-
phasis on lecturers of interest
who are area experts, for example
from the Barnes collection or
Philadelphia Museum of Fine Arts.

Student suggestion and interest
are the factors that can and should
determine Council’s program, Di-
ana Hamilton and your hall rep-
resentative are approachable and
receptive .o your ideas. Lists
will be posted in Taylor next week
for nominations to Secretary and
Treasurer.

Evokes Rebuttal, Vigorous Dissent

Soggy senior songmistress Bobbie Hurwitz reefs in streamers from may

which has been caused by the
formation of the Haverford com-

_ A Calculated Plea

To the Editor:

We. hear a lot nowadays about the
increasing importance of science
in our culture. I suppose that
everybody is aware also of how
most of the sciences depend more
and. more on mathematics for
understanding them. .The wave of
“‘New Math’? in the schools has
revealed to many educated people
that their understanding of math-
ematics was shallow and narrow.
One would expect Bryn Mawr stu-
dents; who presumably insist on

«the most penetrating and up-to-
date approach to the intellectual.

disciplines which interest them, ,, Math,

to be sensitive to the increasing

need for mathematics in many
fields, and also to have. some
curiosity about the subject itself.
.Yet the numbers electing any math
courses. at Bryn Mawr are rel-
atively low, andshow no increasing
trend. On. the chance that one
reason for this is some misunder -
standing. of our introductory
courses, I am writing this letter,

We. offer. two. courses without
prerequisites ; other than the min-
imum mathematics required for
admission to Bryn. Mawr. Math,
101,
and more specialized course which

_lays the foundations for further _
work in Mathematics, Physics and

Chemistry. Math 103, on the other
hand, is a non-traditional, un-
specialized course, intended to

strengthen the hand of the person .

who needs to read or use Math-
ematics in any other field, or

who, short of a major, wishes -
to test her interest in Mathematics

itself, The difference between the
courses is not only-one of subject
matter. (Math 103 might include
some of the ideas of calculus,
but with most of the emphasis

on other topics from algebra, logic, —

set theory, probability, statistics

ete) Because of its role in-start-
ing majors, and because it must -

cover certain standard techniques

has to keep up a pace which is
apparently hard for some students,
even when on paper they have the
prerequisites, Math, 103, by con-
trast, is somewhat free to adjust
its content and pace to the needs
of the students taking it. While
not either a lower level course,

‘nor a remedial course -- it will

work on_ sophisticated and
important mathematical ideas at
a mature level -- it is intended
to be deliberately hospitable to
those students who feel insecure
in their ability or previous train-
ing.

103 would not be
‘appropriate as an ally to Physics

Stetler’s Hearing Raises

BMC and NDEA |
Offer Loan Funds

Bryn Mawr College now admin-
dsters two major types of loan pro-
grams. The first is the college’s
own fund, consisting of the Stv-. —
dents’ Loan Fund of the Alumnae ©
Association,: the Mary Hill Swope
Loan Fund and the Gerard and
Mary Hill Swope Loan Fund, The
second is the National Defense Stu-
dent Loan Program, available to
Bryn Mawr students for the first
time this year.

Both sources offer loans tofull-

time undergraduate and graduate
students at low interest rates and
with favorable terms of repayment.
Since it will now be necessary for
a loan applicant to select which .
_ program will be more suitable. to

her needs, the following differences

should be noted:

Interest; BMC funds, 2%; NDEA
funds, 3%.

Years to repay: BMC funds, five,
beginning one year after comple-
tion of studies; NDEA funds; ten
years, beginning two years after
completion of studies.

Maximum amount, student may
borrow yearly: BMC funds, $500.; ~
NDEA funds, $1,000,

Fotal maximum amount student
“may borrow: BMC funds, $1,500;
NDEA funds, $5,000.

Both funds offer deferral of re-
payment for graduate work. BMC
funds ‘have no ‘‘forgiveness”’ for
teaching, but NDEA forgives up to
~~

Because the ‘‘forgiveness’’
clause of the NDEA Loans allows
cancellation of the debt at the rate
of 10% forsevery year in which the
borrower teaches in public secon-

..dary school systems (up to a max-
imum cancellation of 50% of the
total loan), the NDEA doan should.
be_of_ interest .to..anyone. who.is..
considering teaching. Further-
more, there is legislation pending
to extend the coverage to those
teaching in private schools and at
the college level, It will also be of
interest to those whose needs are
greater than can be covered by the
college funds. In any case, a re-
quest for loan assistance must be
accompanied (in the case of under-
graduate students) by the Parents’
Confidential Statement, available
from the Dean’s Office. Thosé who
- wish. to be considered for a Gov-
ernment Loan must make an ap-
pointment with the Dean’s (Scho-

Duties of Students
In Community Life

On. October 5, the Bryn Mawr
League held its first conference
of the 1964-65 academic year.
Nancy Bradeen, League president,
Mr. Donald Archer of the YMCA,
Mrs. Walter Foster of the Bryn
Mawr School Board, Rev. Burton
of Bethel AME Church, Dr. Ber-
nard Ross, professor of social
work and social research, and

.. Ginny Kerr of the Social Action

Club co-operated in a panel dis-
cussion to explore areas of com-
mon interest and concern between
the students .of the college and
the residents of Bryn Mawr.

Members of the panel spoke of,
several current community activi-!

ties and many possible future pro-
jects in which Bryn Mawr students
could participate.

dren, lending services to Girl~

Scout troops, and working with the
YMCA on physical edygation and
camping programs. In addition to
these, they urged students to con-
tribute their time and energy to
election activities this fall.

In her introduction to the dis-
cussion, Nancy outlined the gov-
ernmental, social, and economic
aspects of the town of Bryn Mawr.
She cited the difficulties involved
in governing the town which is
located in two counties and three

- townships.

After an opening statement for
the panel by Dr. Ross, Mrs. Foster
emphasized the need for programs
including pre-school children. Ac-
cording to recent reports of the
local school board, such things
as reading to these younger chil-
dren and taking them’ on: field
trips greatly adds to their chances
of adjusting well in. elementary’
school. A recent proposal to be-

The six Negro members of the

Fund for Negro Students. Mrs.
Hotten was interested in: hearing
about their reactions to their pro-

social life at Bryn-Mawr,.

The NSSAFFNS is an organi-

students into inter-racial or pre-

“dominantly white colleges. Among

its activities, it keeps voluminous
files on which colleges want or
don’t want Negro students, ~—

Mrs. -Hotten of the New York

bringing the file up to date. Since
the six, Valerie Fisher of Georgia,
Jacqueline Williams of. Florida,
and Wonza Williamson, Barbara
Webb, Marsha Young, and Jessica
Harris of New York State, agreed
that Bryn Mawr was comfortable,
the topic turned to dating.

The twoSoutherners were rather
surprised by inter-racial dating
and found it quite different, but
the four New. Yorkers are rather
used to it.

The students agreed that the
majority of high school guidance
counselors are not aware of ed-
ucational opportunities for Ne-

The recent’ editorial in the
COLLEGE NEWS which criticized
the lack of standardization of the
fire drill rules did make some
valid comments. This year we are
reconsidering and rewriting all the
rules and regulations in an effort
to eliminate the inconsistent and
the unnecessary rules. Any fur-
ther comments or suggestions are
welcome.

The NEWS, however, is not justi-
fied in its criticism of the regula-
tion that students must have a
flashlight, towel, coat and shoes
at a fire drill. The requiring of
this ‘*paraphernalia’’ is to expedite
a SAFE evacuation of the building.
The reason that a student is not
required to go back to her room
to get her things, if she is in
another room when the fire bell
rings, is not because she doesn’t
‘*need’”? them, but because it would
be quicker and safer for her to
share the equipment of a friend
or to borrow someone’s extra
coat and towel than to return to
her own room.

Nurse Farr Joins Ranks
Of “Bryn Mawr Authors”

By Peggy Wilber

All students realize that many
members of the faculty are pub-
lished authors, but fewer seem to
be aware that probably the most
recent publication by a ‘‘Bryn
Mawr author,’? CHILDREN IN
MEDICINE, is the work of Muriel
Farr, Head Infirmary Nurse, and
also a seasoned author.

Miss Farr’s book, published by
Prentice-Hall, is a collection of
stories of fhe childhood of persons
such as Florence Nightingale and
Robert Koch whose youthful in-
terests and inquiries led to ex-
citing medical discoveries. She
also tells the story of several
brave young human guinea pigs,
such as Jean-Baptiste Jupile, one
of the first children to be injected
with Pasteur’s rabies vaccine.

PerhapS the most refreshing
aspect of Miss Farr’s book is its
ability to present the scientifi_
method in an interesting and ex-
citing manner for quite young chil-
dren -- instead of the dry imper-
sonal tales of the ubiquitous mag-
gots in the meat or Pavlov’s pant-
ing dog that are everywhere in
elementary science texts. This is
especially well done in her offer-
ing, ‘‘Why British Sailors are
Called Limeys,’’ the story of
Captain Cooks’ battle against
scurvy. Captain Cook, who ran
away to sea as a boy, did not be-
come a physician, as did all the
other great medical figures in
this book, but he did make careful
observations on the value of fresh
fruit on sailing voyages, and his
logical and inspired researches
are presented in a lively and
straight-forward fashion.

The idea for the book came
while Miss Farr was still in
nurses’ training. She worked part
time at the Haverford school, car-
ing for ‘‘very inquisitive little
boys who were constantly asking
WHY we tapped their chests, and
did other things, and I realized
I didn’t know some of the answers
myself!?? Therefore she began re-

search, and writing followed. The
specific problem of chest-tapping
is tackled in her story of Leopold
Auenbrugger, an innkeeper’s son
who tapped on wine casks as a boy
to ascertain their fullness, and on
men’s chests as a physician to
determine the amount of fluid
therein.

Mississippi F.D.P.
Seeks Volunteers
For Election Work

The Mississippi Freedom
Democratic Party, which chal-
lenged the seating of the regular
Mississippi delegates to the Demo-
cratic Convention, is calling for
500 volunteers to work in Missis-
sippi for a week before the election,

The FDP is conducting a ‘‘free-
dom vote,’? a mock election in
which all Mississippians of vot-
ing age can express their pre-
ference for President, Senator,
and Representatives. ,

The FDP is running candidates
against Senator Stennis and three
Representatives, and it has en-
dorsed President Johnson. The
FDP candidates are not on the
state ballot,

The purpose of the freedom vote
is to show that thousands of Missis-
sippians have been illegally disen-
franchised, and that, if they were
allowed to vote, the results of
elections would change radically,

On the basis of the freedom vote,
the FDP will ask Congress to rule
invalid the elections of Senator
Stennis andthe three congressmen.
If that fails, the FDP hopes to have
the Democratic caucus strip them
of their seniority status, from
which they gain most of their
power,

Anyone who is interested in
going to help with the freedom
vote should immediately contact
Edna Perkins in Denbigh for fur-
ther details and application forms,

the Editor

freshments are provided, however,
in the event of a hall Faculty Tea.

Each hall may have and finance
one (1) mixer or dance each aca-
demic year in the hall, and if
desired, another one (1) or more
may be held in Goodhart (not the
Music Room), Applebee Barn, or
the gym if these are not in use.
The reason more mixers are not
allowed in the dorm is that not all
girls in the hall go to the hall
mixer and might be disturbed by
the additional noise.

A great wealth of possibilities
for additional activity operating
within these limits occurs to me,
as well as the obvious solution,
changing the college _ policy.
Greater student cooperation would
be especially helpful. The social
life you save may be your own.

Participants in Tutorial Project

Plan to Widen

The Bryn Mawr-Haverford tu-
torial project is expanding its
operations this year to reach more
pupils in Ardmore, Philadelphia,
and Bryn Mawr. For the first
time work in remedial reading as
well as subject tutoring is planned,

At present 70 Bryn Mawr and
45 Haverford students have signed
up as tutors, but the goal is a
total squad of two hundred. Ninety
will tutor in Ardmore, 60 in Bryn
Mawr, and 35 in Philadelphia. An
increase in demand for tutors
is expected after the first school
marking period,

Students of all ages, from ele-
mentary to senior high school, will
be assisted. A Philadelphia school
and church congregations are se-
lecting the pupils. Tutoring will
be conducted in one church in each
community,

Each tutor will be assigned one
student for one hour each week.

Interfaith Presents
Wednesday Talks,

Sunday Mediation

Dr. Henry J. Cadbury, a trustee
of Bryn Mawr and a past head of
the Society of Friends will speak
at the regular Interfaith lecture
on Wednesday, October 21. The
last speaker was Jonathon Smith,
the controversial minister from
Yale.

Interfaith, besides sponsoring
lectures every other Wednesday,
is intending to continue its program
of music and meditation on Sun-
days. However, final arrangements
of time and place have not yet been
made, Interfaith president Carly
Wade stated that all of Interfaith’s
activities result as a response to
students’ requests.

The organization is now in a
position to set up transportation
for students who wish to attend
churches of interest suchas Christ
Church in Philadelphia. Requests
should be made to any Interfaith
representative.

With the new Calendar of Events
Bulletin there is the possibility of
trading guest speakers, and co-
sponsoring discussion groups with
Haverford. Interfaith is organizing
talks on unlimited topics one after -
noon a week, to promote discussion
of questions and the spread of in-
formation concerning religious is-
sues on campus and inthe commun-
ity.

Scope of Work

The program will later be broad-
ened to include field trips and
other outside activities. Most of
the students are Negro children
of low income families who cannot
afford to hire tutors,

To further help his pupil, the
tutor may be in contact with parents
and teachers, This arrangement
will allow each person being tu-
tored to receive individual atten-
tion impossible in large school
classes.

In addition to academic subjects,
tutors will work with remedial
reading, since a reading problem
is often the basis for difficulties
in other areas.

Now in its third year, the tu-
torial project is headed by Leslie
Hiles at Bryn Mawr and Chris
Filstrip at Haverford.

Transportation is provided for
those tutoring in Ardmore and
Philadelphia. The Bryn Mawr lo-
cation is within walking distance.
Tutoring sessions will be held
in the late afternoon and early
evening during the week and Sa-
turday morning.

National Foreign Service Board
Seis Exam Date for Candidates

The Department of State will
offer competitive examinations in
Philadelphia on Saturday, De-
cember 5, leading to appointment
as Career Officers in the Foreign
Service of the United States. Ap-
plication for these examinations,
available at the Bureau of Re-

by Monday, October 19.

Mr. Vincent Wilber, a Foreign
Service Recruiting Representa-

day for tea, at which he described
the preliminary written examina-
tion consisting of a battery of
five tests given in one day.

The test includes exercises in
General Ability, English Expres-
sion, Writing an English Essay,
and General Background as well
as one of five special optional
tests. These tests are graded on
a relative rather than absolute
basis, so that the candidates are
in competition with the other can-
didates.

Applicants for the written exam-
inations must be between the ages

College Staff

As Shakespeare Instructor

Miss Patricia H. Russell, who
is just completing her work for
the Ph.D. degree, is Bryn Mawr’s
new Shakespeare instructor. She
also is teaching a contemporary
English course for freshmen.

**] always wanted to teach, and
decided on English when I majored
in it,’? Miss Russell said. She did
undergraduate work at Sweetbriar
and received her M.A. degree from
the University of Toronto from
which she will receive her Ph.D.
degree after finishing her thesis
on how Shakespeare’s last romance
themes can be used dramatically.

As a teaching fellow at Victoria
University in Toronto she taught
Victorian and modern prose and
poetry.

Next to Shakespeare Miss Rus-
sell likes the poet Yeats and con-
temporary English literature.
Asked what her favorite Shake-
spearean plays were she com-
mented, ‘It depends on what type
of mood I am in, but they are
probably A MIDSUMMER NIGHT’S
DREAM and THE TEMPEST be-
cause they are formal and yet
vast in scope.’’ One of her favor-
ite quotations from MSND is:

s¢ ... O happy fair!

Your eyes are lodestars and your
tongue’s sweet air

More tuneable that lark to shep-
herd’s ear

When wheat is green, when haw-
thorne buds appear.’’

Miss Russell’s other love is
music, ‘‘anything up to Mozart.’?
Years ago she taught piano be-
cause it was ‘‘twice as profit-
able as babysitting.’? More re-
cently she spent a summer teach-
ing rhythm and dynamics in music
to mountain children at a workshop
in Berea, Kentucky.

Miss Russell has also traveled
over much of Europe. ‘I like Lon-
don best, especially Westminster
Abbey,’’ she stated, adding that
she felt most at home in England
because she felt she knew it from
reading so much in books. Salz-
burg, Austria, was another favor-
ite place. Miss Russellis present-

‘ly saving for another trip to

Europe.

Doing research work in the Fol-
ger Shakespeare Library in her
native city of Washington, D.C.,
has occupied Miss Russell for
the last two summers.

Five Students Use Ford Summer Grants
For Research on Honors Project Topics

By Darlene Preissler

During the past summer, five
Bryn Mawr students, Joan Deutsch,
Michele Green, Jo Frodin, Kathy
Terzian, and Peggy Wilber, util-
ized funds from Ford Foundation
Grants to engage in research in
several fields, .
“The Ford Foundation awards the
grants for the purpose of furthering
research in ‘‘public affairs, gov-
ernmental and political processes
and public policies.” In addition,
the foundation aims to ‘frelate
teaching and research through
faculty and student cooperation in
research projects.”

Joan Deutsch chose the Immunity
Act of 1954 for her topic. The law
states that in cases where the
national security is concerned,
people may be forced to testify.
Their statements, in theory, are
to be regarded only as informa-~
tion and are not to be held against
them in any manner. Joan com-
pleted most of her research at the

Northwestern Law Library in
Chicago.
Colombia’s inflation problem

was the subject of Jo Frodin’s re-

search, She gained information
on the topic from the University
of the Andes, the only non-political
university in South America, and
from the Banco de la Republica,
the central bank of the country.
For six weeks, she resided
in Bogota and also travelled to
the tropical regions of Colombia,

Traveling to Belgium, Germany,
Switzerland, and Italy and living
for three weeks with a German
family were included in Kathy
Terzian’s project on the European
Common Market, She participated
in a study group on the Common
Market co-sponsored by the Ex-
periment in International Living
and the State University of New
York. Meetings with policy makers
and members of various interest
groups provided information which
could not be obtained from written
sources.

Peggy Wilber selected the Druze
Sect, a community of heretical
Moslems residing in Syria, Leb-
anon, and Israel, as her area of
concentrated study. In particular,
she researched the manner in
which religious sects are repre-
sented in the government of Leb-

anon. For eight weeks, she used
resources in Washington, at
Princeton, and at Harvard,

The information gained through
the research this summer will be
included in the students’ honors
projects.

Passage of the written examina-
tion is followed by oral and medical
exams and evaluation of personal
information regarding the candi-

for further consjderation after the
oral exam.

When a candidate establishes
eligibility through successful com-

This’ is meant: te Be) both an.

fact that Radnor Hall still cannot
receive WHRC radio...

WHRC’s transmission to Bryn
Mawr College is achieved by first

--gending an. audio-signal over. spe-

cial telephone lines from our stu-
dios at Haverford College to each
dormitory at Bryn'Mawr. This
audio signal is then fed intotrans-
mitters at each dormitory, using

the AC wiring as the antenna |

(known as Carrier-Current Trans-

and still comply with FCC, regu-
lations concerning non-licensed
AM transmission. 3

We presently have transmitters
working in Rhoads, Rockefeller,
Pembroke East and..West, Den-

bigh, and Merion. The problem

with Radnor is that the telephone
company has no available wires
going into Radnor Hall for our

eolns to re-engineer their wiring

is in, The telephone company, to

date, has given us no estimation ©

talented students of Bryn Mawr

comedies occasionally),

We were told that there is an
auditorium at Haverford, but that
it is not very big, This might not
be a disadvantage. A small, packed
house is better than a huge, half-
filled hall, particularly when
everyone in the small house can
see and hear, If an extra per-

would probably be a delightful

keeping with the tradition of a .
slightly slanted roof with visible —
cross-bracing. In some misguided
effort to dispel the gloominess,
or perhaps to reflect supplicants’
thoughts back down upon them,
someone had painted intricate
figures, in gold on the bracing,
and in red on the underside of the
roof. It being past 10 p.m., the

tiptoed as softly as possible onthe
hard wooden floor to find two ad-
jacent cubicles, After settling our-

what shriné of concentration was
being guarded. The fellow to my

with an amplitude of less than
one inch; the small squeal emitted

rebounded from the end walls, and .

time as the reflection from the
slanted sides of the roof focused
upon a point not far from my left
ear, The originally small. squeal
sounded like a truckload of pigs
being driven at high speed over a

repeated rocking movion built into

a periodic function of rising and
falling bombardments of squeal-

hog-carriers converging in one
continuous wreck near my left ear.
I tried to ignore it and concen-

pistol-shot, next gathering-up her

Miss Sidney Donaidson, the eee
retary to the Dean, is retiring at
the end of this month after twenty-
three years on the Bryn Mawr pay-
rolls. Being Secretary tothe Dean,
she has had a staff of three to help
her in a job that, as Mrs. Murtz of
the Bureau of Recommendations
put it, ‘entails a little bit of every-
thing.’ This all-inclusive job
amounts to dealing with all the aca-
demic information, miscellaneous
as well as vitally important, that

‘goes through the Dean’s office.

This has put her in contact with
thousands _of_.students over the.
years. In fact, she was a student
here herself once. She was gradu-
ated in 1921, majoring in French
and Sparlish.

Between 1921 and1941,when she
returned here, she worked for the
Shipley School, and for seven years
as Secretary to the President at
Haverford. In accordance with her
life-long hobby of gardening, she
has taken classes at the Barnes.
Arboretum in Merion.

All during this time she has liv-
ed in Ardmore with her mother and
sister,, Now, with Miss Donaldson’s
retirement, all three are moving to
Florida. They have already bought
a house, with a yard that could do
with a little landscaping. But that’s
no problem: with her extensive
knowledge of horticulture (‘‘She
knows. everything about shrubs and
trees and plants,’’ said Mrs. Kath-
erine Whelihan enviously), she is
already looking forward to putting
the Florida sunshine to work. No
flower could resist growing for a
combination like that.

Bryn Mawr’s nine-girl cheer-
leading squad was honored this
week by Haverford for its un-
daunted enthusiasm in this year’s
less-than-successful football sea-

record.)

The cheerleaders were escorted

to Haverford Tuesday morning for~

Lawrence, co-captain of the foot-
ball team, presented the girls
with gold pins bearing the Haver-
ford insignia. Also honored were
Haverford’s faithful fife and drum
corps. ,

Receiving pins were Joyce Blair,
Popie: Johns, Alma Lee, Steffi
Lewis, Elena Mestre, Gene Fiac-

Gov. Scranton, State Officials
Quizzed by Collegiate Press.

Pennsylvania Governor William -
W: Scranton’s annual College Press. -

Conference was held in the state
capitol building in Harrisburg on
December 9. For all intensive
‘purposes, the’ collegiate journal-
Ysts, aided and abetted by the reg-
ular Capitol newsstaff, interrogat-
ed the Governor for an hour.

After a brief welcome by Jack
Donnelley, the governor’s press
secretary, students. representing
Pennsylvania colleges and univer-
sities, private an§ state-controll-
ed, hurled questions at Governor
Scranton. Topics ranging in scope
from political philosophy to speci-
fic issues involving practical poli-
tics were buffeted candidly by Mr.
Scranton.

These were the interesting fea-
tures of the press conference; that
students were considered capable
of maintaining the tenor in sucha
situation, given the fact that all
aspects of state government were
readily accessible to thaSe.in at-

tendance; that even the ‘‘loaded’’ |

questions were treated with forth-
right honesty by the Governor,
who did not hesitate to saysowhen
he was unable to ‘adequately re-
spond to an inquiry concerning

particular bills of very individual.

interest; that the subjects discus -
sed involved thecposition in rela-
tion to taxes on textbooks, conver-
sion of certain state colleges to
universities, partisan accusations
during and after the recent elec-

ion, and even direct inquiry ,as to
“William W. Scranton’s individual

aspirations for 1966 and 1968.

Teaching Careers

Discussed at Tea.
By Headmistresses

Undergrad’s continuing program
of Job Opportunity Teas presented
Miss Mary Carter,. Principal of
Radnor High School, and Miss
Margaret Speer, Headmistress of
the Shipley School yesterday after -
noon in the Common Room.

Miss Carter spoke first, des-
cribing the practice teaching pro-
gram at Radnor High School, in
which many Bryn Mawr girls have

and are participating. She also

stressed the many.new techniques

-in' teaching such as television,

team teaching, language labs, and
the rise of college-level courses
in secondary schools.

Miss Speer stated that the dif-
ference between public and private
schools may not be the difference
between public and private, as
much as that between large and
small. In quoting-from a question-
naire attempting to evaluate teach-
er reaction to teaching, she stated
that there seemed to be little dif-
ference between the replies of the
public and private school teachers.
She also added that the most com-
mon disadvantage cited, that of
dissatisfaction with administra-
tion, was not necessarily confined
to teaching, and thus not a specific
SE Oa

Following the formal question-
answer period, ‘*open house’ was
held in all the state departments
of government. Students were in-
vited to pursue.the issues which
interested them in discussion with
the various secretaries and direc-
tors ‘of the State departments.

The Honorable Walter Alessan-
droni, the Attorney General, fur-
ther demonstrated the frank open-
ness characteristic of, the
Conference in speaking of the prac-
tical aspects of the textbook ‘tax
audits mechanical difficulties, the
Liquor Control Board and the State
law concerning this matter , andthe
question of the magistracy and the
backlog of cases, particularly in
large cities.

Dr. Rien Presents

Anti-Poverty Talk
In League Series

By Roberta Smith

Dr; Martin Rien of the Bryn
Mawr School of Social Work spoke
Tuesday in the Common Room on
the recent Anti-Poverty legis-
lation. His lecture was sponsored
by League.

Dr. Rien sought to present an
objective analysis of the program
and to give a‘‘framework for look-
ing into its organization.’’ He
presented both the advantages and
disadvantages of the Bill, and
pointed out criticism from both
the left,and right.

Criticisms. of the bill, he re-
marked, range from the accusation
that the bill was designed merely
as a vote-getter and (as one
Socialist says) as a ‘‘mocking
and a fraud” to the assertion that
the ‘*War on Poverty’’ is becoming
a ‘‘War on the Poor,’’ seeking to
bring pressure on _ deprived
classes.

Dr. Rien went on to show how
the new bill is, in its different.
aspects, both a departure from and
a continuity of past legislation, in
the field of.poverty. It differs from
the ideas exemplified in New Deal
legislation in’that it seeks to pro-
vide genuine ‘‘equality of oppor-
tunity’? rather than simply income
security.

The emphasis on ‘‘inculcating
good work habits,’”? and thus re-
ducing the dependency of a poten-
tially productive portion of our
society is an idea carried over
from New Deat legislation.

He went on to outline the basic
structure of the Bill itself, a
two-faceted program which will
seek to combat ainemployment by
providing opportunities and job
training for young people and by

facilitating community action
against poverty.
‘We periodically rediscover

poverty,’’ said Dr. Rien -- and
this he believes is the most signi-
ficant contribution of the new bill
-- by bringing the problem of
poverty into the public eye, it will
lead to new and better solutions to .

_.an ever-present question. Fi

Politicking On Berkeley Campus
Erupts Into Free Speech Fight

The festering political activity

controversy at the University of ~

California’s .Berkeley campus

reached a, new level of intensity’
last week as California police ar--

rested hundreds of students for
staging a sit-in in the university’s
(administration building.

Near chaos reigned on the 83,710
student campus a8.state and Berke-
ley police, acting jon orders from
California Gévernor Edmund G.
(Pat) Brown, hauled away 801 stu-
dent demonstrators who | had
*¢seized’’ Sproul Hall in a protest
growing out of the university’s
decision to ban student political
activity from the campus,

‘Most of those arrested have

for the most part by the faculty.

of California’ in the building, and
for twelve hours before Brown
ordered some 600 policemen to

‘ disperse the demonstration, they

sang freedom songs and listened
to lectures by student leaders
and professors.

The arrests began shortly after
-8 a.m,, Thursday, December 3,
after Strong urged students to get
out of ‘the building of their own
accord, When only a few got up to
leave, the police moved in and
started arresting demonstrators.

Letters From Berkeley

The following letters are by
graduate students (one of whom
graduated from Bryn Mawr in
1963) at the University of Cali-
fornia~concerning ~the Berkeley
campus’ Free Speech Movement.
The problem over free speech
and assembly first arose in Sep-
tember. and has continued with
rioting and demonstrations ever
since. The solution does. not yet
‘ appear ‘in. sight.

Help Wanted

I am now sitting along with more
than 3 thousand other students
of the Unizig yzity of California,
at Berkery,’ who have dem-
onstrated silently before a meet-
ing of the State. Regents, You are
‘aware, I’m sure, ofthe free speech
movement initiated here on Sep-
tember 30th, Since that time, there
have beendemonstrations, a period
of negotiation, and dispute over
what regulations the Adminis-
tration of this univefsity should
and ‘could rightfully impose on the
political life and activities of its
students.

Today, on. the date of Decision

’ by the Regents, hopes were high.

Joan’ Baez came at noon and led
a two hour rally, after which
we —_walked_-quietly, six abreast,
to the place of the meeting. We
have just been informed (at about
3:30) that the Regents, upon Pres-
ident Clark Kerr’s recommenda-
tion, voted that certain Hyde Park
areas within the: campus be set
up which university students and
staff could utilize to advocate law-
ful political and social action; to
ask for contributions, and to so-
licit membership. for lawful
activity.

Although this is one step for-
ward .(during the past six weeks
it has been unlawful to do any of
the abové three things at all),
we object to the idea that the
on-campus action must be
“‘lawful,’’ for it implies that the
administration will determine what
is lawful, and that adds up to a
form of prior restraint.

Thousands of students here, un-
der the banner of the Free Speech
Movement, have -urged that the
‘Regents realize that only the courts
.can determine whether a political

action or activity is lawful or
unlawful, They have proclaimed,
futhermore, that political and so-
cial action should be encouraged,
and not restrained, on a univer-
sity campus. Free speech and the
right to assemble cannot stop at
the classroom. Nor can just ana
fair limits be placed on these
rights by the administration ofa
state-supported and therefore po-
litically pressured institution,

I write to inform you of what
is happening, in hopes that you
will tell others about it as well.

And, of course, any and allexpres- ©

sions of support from individuals,
from organizations, or from the
Bryn Mawr community (excluding
administration and faculty) will be
appreciated. They will have most
impact if directed either to: The
Board of.Regents of the State of
California, c/o Mr. Clark Kerr,
President of the University of
California, Berkeley, or to The
Free Speech Movement, c/o Mario
Savio, Box 809, Berkeley, Calif-

I do hope you will take action

on this, It is important not just-

to the U, Cal. students, not just
to all students, but to all citizens.

Sue Gumpert (?63)

Incoherent?

If I be a bit incoherent, please
forgive. I have beén up 48 hours
over the rioting here.

November 14, the Regents in-
stituted a new rule which was
clearly. contrary to the First
Amendment. December 2, the stu-
dents demonstrated and 800 were
arrested by state cops ordered in
by Governor Brown.

Then hell broke out. 18,000 stu-
dents (or so) are refusing to
attend classes. 75% of all Teaching
Assistants and more than half the
faculty are refusing to teach. The
American Association of Univer-
sity Préfessors has asked for the
Chancellor’s resignation. The
faculty is threatening to close the
school.

I am going to bed now for the
first time in days.

for a teaching strike and -class
“poyeott wn the carpus for Friday,
December 4.

An FSM _ spokesman said he
thought the strike and boycott was
‘tabout 85 percent effective.’’ La-=
‘bor organizations in the Bay Area
seemed to be honoring FSM picket
lines at the university, as food
deliveries to university cafeterias
and construction on university
buildings was suspended,

In Sacramento, Governor Brown
rejected a plea for amnesty for
the 800, saying, ‘‘We’re not going
to have anarchy in the state of
California, and that’s coenene sa
tion) anarchy.’’

The resolution calling for the
implementation of the new regent’s
policies referred to a regent’s
ruling that. granted. students the
right to engage in ahy sort of
‘‘legal’? activity.on campus, but
permitting the university admin-
istration to take disciplinary ac-
tion against students engaged in
activity that would result in viola-
tion of the law -- presumably sit-
ins and other forms. of civil. dis -
obedience.

The Free aneeeh miearnent
termed the ruling unacceptable

Kerr criticized the FSM for
*‘distortion,’’ ‘‘irrationality,’’ and
*¢ill will,’? and, said the issue had

-nothing to do with free speech, but
rather concerned political action.

In past years, students had used
the plaza at the Sather Gate en-
trance to the campus as a ‘‘Hyde
Park’? area for debates, rallies
and political speeches.

This fall, long after the Repub-
lican National Convention, pro-
Goldwater students complained to
school officials about the manner
in which supporters of Governor
William Scranton: had used the area
to recruit backers for the Pennsyi-
vania Governor.

This eventually led the dean of
students, Katherine Towle, to in-
voke a long-ignored regulation
prohibiting the use of the area for
off-campus political purposes.
Students defied the ban and began
the protests.

At the February 15th meeting of
the Undergraduate Association, a
motion concerning a major change
in the stature and purpose of the
Student Curriculum Committee
was proposed, voted upon and
passed, The question was raised
spontaneously and had not been
included on the agenda. Since the
timing of this discussion coincided
with a television program “about
Haverford’s self-scheduled ex-

amination system and because this -

matter is currently the central
business before the Curriculum
Committee, I was not present at the
Undergrad meeting, nor was’ an-

‘other ‘‘qualified’? member of the

committee. All students on cam-
pus interested in the possibility
of self-scheduled exams at BMC
had been urged to watch the tele-
vision presentation,

It would seem that Undergrad’s
sense of proportion has been some-
what distorted. They are, ineffect,
elevating the Curriculum Com-
mittee toa position equal to that
of one of the “Big Five,’’ giving
its chairman a- seat on College
Yet, they effected this
measure in the space of fifteen
minutes with discussion, infor-
mation and consideration which
seems inadequate in light of the
magnitude of this change. More-
over, the selection of the chair-
man of this organization has been
delegated to the student body and
Undergrad, the representative or-
ganization, has not yet determinéd
the function, the purpose or the

relationship of this committee to
other college organizations, Thus,
I consider that this question has
been insufficiently discussed, both
by. Undergrad and by the Bryn
Mawr students at large, since
such a.major policy change will
ultimately affect each member of

‘the college community,

I therefore submit that the
motion passed by Undergrad last
week be reconsidered and that the
issue be presented to allow time
for careful thought. If the campus
should fervently desire to elect
the chairman of the Student Cur-
riculum Committee, there seems
no necessity for hasty action
merely to accommodate the pres-
sent impending dinner system. The
nature and scope of this decision
merit more’ than a single day’s
thought and certainly more than
a single night’s action.

| Arts Council Candidates Propose Self Gov Nominees Encourage
| Increased Student Participation More Individual Responsibility

Hilary Hosmer
I have been allowed only three

hundred words to describe what I

would do with Arts Council next
year so hang on!

First, Arts council must do
more to incr Student aware-
ness of local cultural. oppor-
tunities, Let’s promote subscrip-
tions to the invaluable WFLN
Philadelphia guide. Let’s ‘distri-
bute an Arts “Field of Interest’’
check list to every student, so
that she will be included on the
mailing lists of local organiza-
tions. Let’s circulate. more ‘thow,
when and at what cost”’ information

D.K. Howe Plans
To Extend Current
Interfaith Program

As the president of the Inter-
faith Association, I would like to
continue the programs that we
have found successful this year,
strengthen these programs and fol-
low any suggestions which would
make the association more effec-
tive on campus. The primary pur-



pose of Interfaith is to make the

student aware of the activities of

ge



Dorothy Knox Howe
her religious organization in this
area and to help her to establish
contacts with this organization. I
hope to strengthen. the area of
church co-ordination and to see
that every student on campus who
wishes to do so can find and par-
ticipate in the religious organ-
ization of her choice. Through
more efficient publicity, I hope to
make _ information of the activities
both of the Interfaith Organization
and. of the religious organizations
in this area easily accessible to
all interested.

I. would like for our lecture
series for the coming year tocon-
tinue to represent a wide range of
religions and of topics pertinent
to religion in general, and I hope
that we can sponsor more pro-
grams such as Albee’s THE ZOO
STORY which were successful this
year.

The discussion groups that began
this year due to a great deal of
demand from the students last
year, have been extremely suc-
cessful and I want to encourage all
interested to participate. Another
successful innovation this year
has been several programs of re-
ligious choral music in the library
reading room on Sunday mornings.
This I would like to continue and to
make amore regular occurrence.
In the past we have sponsored

‘several trips into Philadelphia and
the surrounding area to services
at the Greek Orthodox church,
Christ Church in historical Phil-
adelphia, Jewish synagogues and
visits to Father Divine. I would
like to see this part of Interfaith’s
program given more emphasis in
order to create more and better
understanding between students of
different faiths,

Finally, I am open to any sug-
gestions which the student body
might give, for Interfaith exists
to serve the student.



about local institutions like the
Barnes Foundation and the Univer-
sity Museum,
Secondly, Arts Council must.
strive to bring more artistic
activities” to the campus. Let’s
arrange to entertain more student
groups like the Princeton chamber
music quartet,.and the Union Col-
lege twosome that presented the
ZOO STORY. Let’s really get
monthly .painting exhibits into
the Roost dozens of young
artists would like the chance to
display their works! Let’s con-
tinue our new film series on week-
day evenings and see if we can



Hilary Hosmer |

talk the electrician or a Haver-
fordian into showing the films at ten

o’clock, Let’s bring as. much
activity to .the campus _ in
September, October, and Novem-
ber as we do later in the year.

Thirdly, Arts Council must en-
courage more student creativity on
campus, Let’s continue to work for
an art studio course tobe given for
credit. Let’s make sure more
people know of Mr. Janschka’s
Skinner Workshops; let’s en-
courage informal singing groups by
providing sheet music. Also let’s
make transportation more readily
available to groups like the Dance
Club, so that we can export our
creativity too. Let’s really hold
a student art show.

Finally, let’s strive to make Arts
Council a close-knit working
organization rather than the loose,
dilletantish group it is, The suc-
cess of Arts Council to date has
depended solely uponthe enormous
energy of individuals like Callie
and Diana, If we hold weekly work
meetings (welcoming industrious
volunteers as well as elected hall
representatives)” in order to
arrange programs, make out mail-
ing lists, order and distribute
tickets, etc. I believe Arts Council
can be three times as effective as
it has been in the past.

Today a Senior said to me, ‘I
have not been aware of Arts Council
except as an organization that
sponsors things on campus;”’ anda
Freshman said soon afterwards, **I
don’? think most Freshmen really
have a good idea of what Arts
Council’s role is.’’ ,

Although the reputed lethargy
that keeps many Bryn Mawrters
from being inquisitive about
campus activities may be partially
responsible for this lack of
knowledge,. the fact that Arts
Council has not really been a
campus - centered organization is

The college population of the
U.S.A. is politically ineffective
if not inert. This need not be so.

' Students must realize the power

they could command, as members
of a democratic society, if. they
demanded it and used it maturely.

American college administra-
tions traditionally function ‘in loco
parentis,’? a position which puts
students ‘in loco liberorum”? until
age 22. This makes exercising his
rights off campus as a citizen
difficult for the student. Two years
ago, students at Indiana University
were unjustly arrested for forming
a pro-Cuba committee, The uni-
versity refused to defend the stu-
dents’ rights in the face of public
opinion. Surely the right to join
organizations and to find what

political attitudes he wants to hold °

are necessary parts of a student’s
academic freedom, to say nothing
of his civil rights. Surely uni-
versities would not sacrifice in-
tellectual liveliness because of the
possible ‘‘dangerous elements”’
students would be exposed to -
would they?

To discuss the question of aca-
demic freedom and rights, the
Emergency Civil Liberties Com-
mittee, (ECLC) is sponsoring a
conference on ‘Democracy on
Campus,”’? March 27th at the Uni-

speaker will be Frank Donner,
author of THE UNAMERICANS,
speaking on ‘‘Intimidation of Stu-
dents.’? Others are professor Al
Krebs, formerly of Antioch Col-
lege, and Mario Savio of Berkeley,

A statement of conditions neces-
sary to academic freedom. will
be modified by conferences in
seminar groups, then presented to
the group in final draft. The ECLC
hopes to publish this statement.
A watchdog committee will be
formed to facilitate communica-
tion among campuses represented.

Conference attendants will go

Mrs. Clarissa Pell, Director of
Resources Committee; and Betsey
Pinckney, Rresident of Undergrad;
as well as the district .alumnae
counselors and representatives
gathered for the three days tohear
speeches and discussions on col-
leges in general and Bryn Mawr in
particular.

The first of these was titled

‘‘Looking Ahead to College’? and

was devoted .to discussing how to
help high school students make
realistic college-choices. How to
enlarge the information program
so as to communicate with more
college-bound students was also
brought up.

The topic of primary importance
was ‘**New Thinking in Education
for the Culturally Disadvantaged
Child.’? According to Betsey, this
was the highlight of the whole
Council, Betsey herself gave a
short speech at the Thursday lun-
cheon, She contrasted the Bryn
Mawr of her freshman year to
Bryn Mawr 1965. In those four
years, Bryn Mawr students have
been given increased academic
and social freedom, paralleled
with an increased responsibility
and ‘‘mgral imagination.’’

_ To prove her point, Betsey said
that when attendance ceased to be
taken at classes, more, instead
of fewer, students went to class.

She pointed to the success of the.

tutorial :projects, the fasts for.
freedom, the career opportunity
teas, the self-gov rule changes,
and the SAC seminars on educa-
tion as evidence of the fact that
Bryn Mawr students are not apa-
thetic and unaware of the world
outside the college. Lastly she
notes that students even dress
better than they did four year's ago.

During the three days, the rep-

-resentatives were taken on tours of

St. Louis and the* Washington
University campus, covered at the
time with four inches of snow,

What neither the BULLETIN nor
the two national newsmagazines
pointed out was that the Merit
Corporation itself had taken en-
rollment figires into account in
reporting its statistics.

The controversial table ap-
peared in the 1964 annual report
of the Merit Corporation entitled
*¢Spotlighting Intellectual Distinc-
tion.”? The table was one of two,
printed side by side on the same
__ page. The first, the one quoted by

e news media, listed 25 insti-
tutions most popular among girls,
where popularity was defined as
the total number of students who
named that college as their first
or second choice,

But it was the second, the ig-
nored one, which was the more
significant.-This table listed insti-
tutions highest-ranking in ‘‘esti-
mated selectivity.’® These
**estimated selectivities’’ were
computed by expressing the total
number of students naming a par-.
ticular college as a proportion of
freshmen enrolled by the college.

Bryn Mawr appeared in this
listing, but among its ‘*Seven Sis-
ters’? colleagues, Smith and

‘Vassar did not. And of the 25

institutions listed, all are coed
schools with the exceptions of
Bryn Mawr, Wellesley, and Mount
Holyoke.

“Among men’s colleges, the dis-
crepancy between the corrected
and uncorrected tables was even
greater. Haverford did not appear
among the **most popular’? insti-
tutions, but it stood high on the
list corrected for size. Similarly,
Swarthmore was. listed only when
size was taken into account,

In- general, large universities
predominated on the ‘straight’ list,
but were outnumbered on the cor-
rected list by small private
colleges, both all-men and coedu-
cational.

York City. Nancy Bradeen, Bar-
Xara Sachs and Liesa Stamm, ac-
companied’ by League’s faculty
adviser Miss Kathryn Koenig, at-

On Friday night Mayor Wagner
spoke very optimistically to the
entire group on urbanization in
New York.,

Saturday’s session began at lunch
with two more speakers. Martin
Anderson, Professor of Finance,
Columbia, spoke against urban re-
newal; William M. Birenbaum,
Provost of Long Island University,
discussed the positive aspects of
the city and its diversity of op-
portunity and opinion.

Saturday afternoon offered awide
variety in workshops. Nancy at-
tended the workshop on ‘*The City
Functional or Aesthetic’’ while

of

Barbara and Liesa attended one on “*

“The Emerging Class,’ All three
girls went to the workshop on
‘*Psychological Problems _ of
Urbanization.”” The afternoon
ended with a panel discussion led
by Leon Sinder, head of the So-
ciology Department at Long Island
University.

According to Nancy there was
much enthusiasm displayed, but
nothing conclusive brought out.
‘Since there was no major ques-
tion asked,’’ Nancy said, ‘‘it was
hard to sum up except with a pat
on the back to studénts willing to
study the city,’® Liesa, however,
said that the conference was not

I only wanted to offer a word
of praise to the Freshman class
officers for their: magnificent
handling of class meetings. As
an example to those classes which
precede us and those which shall
follow, here is a brief sample
of the phenomenal organization of
these meetings:

--President-Well, uh, we have a lot
to do here (in 15 minutes) we
have to nominate all of next
year’s officers. Here is, uh,
uh, Mary, no, Jane, no uh, the
chairman of the Sophomore flea
swatting ’er I mean bee beating
committee to tell us about her

office.
--Committee Chairman - To

handle this office well you must
be brilliant, hard-working,
charming, well-talented and fun-
ny. Anyone who takes it has the
simple responsibility of running
the school. It’s fun,.

--Pres.-Oh, Good! Nominations?
(no response)

--Voice from the crowd-Haver-
ford Harry!

--Secretary-How do you spell Har=""~

ry-with or without the ‘‘i’’?

--Pres.-Send out the nominees
(room empties). Now let’s talk
about them.

--Voice from the crowd- That is
my roommate,
--Pres.-Thank-you Well, we have
time for nominations for five
more offices, but. perhaps we
should limit the nominations.
We do have to vote preferen-
tially. All in favor of limiting
the nominations to 55 per office

please wink.

--Sec.-Have you all signed that
attendance list? (a resounding,
unanimous NO! and the room
clears) Wonderful! This is the
sort of thing the college really
needs. More such organization
and we should move gn at neck-
breaking speeds.

An admiring Freshman

Why

To the Editor:

As many times as acivil righter
goes out on a picket line or sit-in,
yea as many times doth someone
ask him, ‘*Why, oh why do you do
that, because it is not only in-
effective, but also  alienates
people?”’

I, not speaking necessarily for
anyone else, picket and sit-in be-
cause I detest the situation in the
society that allows Negroes - or
anyone - to be treated inhumanly.
These peaceful demonstrations are
one of few effective ways of gather-
ing the numbers who feel as I do,
to publish our beliefs tothe public.
Writing to the President does not
ensure that anyone else will know
what I feel.

An effective demonstration is a
highly planned affair; It is no lucky
chance that 10,000 people showed
up at City Hall on Monday, or that
60 students were willing to sleep
in at Independence Hall,

The other reason I demonstrate
is so the next day I can readin the
NEW YORK TIMES that Philadel-
phia students slept under the
Liberty Bell as a protest against
Johnson’s inaction in Alabama, as
did people in 12 other cities, The
overall accumulated numbers in-
volved in the demonstrations serve
to let people know that we think
everything is not all sweetness, If
no one protested, the Selma
violence might have passed by un-
noticed as it did for many years,
But no longer. Johnson notices
when 15,000 people march in tiny
Selma, Alabama.

And I no longer worry about
alienating those people who shrink
from this emotional demonstration
of political feeling. They must
resign themselves to its inevitable
use = because it has been proven

Protest actions against John-
son’s treatment of the violence in
Selma, Alabama March 7 stirred
demonstrations * in Philadelphia
this past week.

The Federal Building was the
target of a joint CORE, SNCC
and Penn NAACP demonstration
last Thursday, Pickets marched
around :carrying such signs as

**Help, Johnson!’’, ‘*Send Federal .

Voter Registrars to Alabama”’ and
**Freedom NOW.” One sign had
read ‘‘JFK - Send Federal Troops

Atty. Mark Lane,
Oswald Defender,
Returns to H ford

Mark Lane, the attorney who
has. continued to plead in Lee
Harvey Oswald’s defense since

President Kennedy’s assassination

in 1963, gave a repeat performance
at Haverford Friday afternoon.

The crux of Lane’s presentation
seems to be that Oswald was not
the only person involved in the
assassination, if.indeed he was in-
volved at all, Out of 259 persons
present at the shooting, ‘Lane
claimed that 91 said the shots
came from behind a fence
positioned in front of the Presi-
dent’s car.

Thirteen. of these witnesses
profess to have seen puffs of smoke
rising from the far side of the
ae and a schoolteacher and a
photographer standing by the fence
said the shots came from over their
heads. ‘

Various other points of Lane’s
argument, although not convincing,
were at least thought-provoking.
For evamnle, Lane said the nation-
ally-published photo of Oswald
posing with the murder weapon
somehow was falsified, in that the
head was superimposed on the
body. The shadows on the face and
the shadows of the body are fall-
ing in different directions; he
pointed out.

Lane told that the son.ef one of
the, Warren Commission’s main
witnesses said his mother was a
pathological liar. The attorney also
attempted to refute anumber of the
Commission’s tests and calcula-
tions as to the possibility of the
accuracy of the shots,

International Living this summer,

The Experiment is based on the
idea that the best way to promote
peace is to gain understanding of
foreign people through living with
them. Participants live with fam-
ilies in their country and are
expected to learn the customs of
the people and to eat their food,
and, in turn, to be able to answer
questions about America,

Leslie, a junior, will be in
India, where she will live with
two different families and spend
a week traveling around the
country.

Betsy, a freshman, will go to
Italy to live for four weeks with
an Italian family and then spend
five weeks traveling around the
country, accompanied by a mem-
ber of the family, with-a group of
other Experiment participants.
The sight-seeing tour will climax

Independence Hall was the scene
of continuous picketing and sitting-
in from Friday through Sunday, Co-
ordinated for Penn NAACP by Ro-

the demonstration included CORE,
SNCC, students from Cheyney Col-
lege, Bryn Mawr SAC and adults.
One Mawrter slept in,

Girl Scouts, a youth orchestra,
plus numerous tourists were met
with pickets and people sitting
around the Liberty Bell, Students
handed out leaflets and offered
a petition requesting enforcement
of the right to assembly, and to
register and vote,

Twenty-eight students slept in-
side the Hall Friday and Saturday
nights to dramatize the urgency
of Federal action in Wallace’s
Alabama, The number was chosen
for lack of space, although 60 were
eager to participate in this
dramatic form of protest.

We would like to point out to
the mysterious ‘‘admiring fresh-
man” that the principal aim of
criticism is to offer constructive
advice on the problem-at-hand,
This aim is not accomplished by
only satirizing the flaws, if they
can be called such, without offer-
ing -a remedy for these faults.
Secondly, a criticism must pre-
sent the facts honestly - a cri-
terion which ‘‘the admirer’ did
not meet, The discussions she
criticized, which havg also taken
place in past years, were intended
to give some idea of dach candi-
date’s qualifications. When it was
seen that this purpose was not being
accomplished, the discussions

were ended. The failure of the

discussions is no reason for con-
demning the attempt to use them.

The ‘admiring. freshman’’
seems to deliberately ignore those
‘things which might invalidate her
criticisms, The ‘‘voice from the
crowd’? who said, ‘*That’s my
roommate,’? succeeded her re-
mark with a statement concerning
her roommate’s qualifications for
office. Almost any*freshman will
say that class meetings have great-
ly improved since the beginning
of the. year. : .

Amusing mistakes should be re-
.garded as just that, not as faults
which ruin the effect ‘ot the meeting.
It is only when class members
fasten on these mistakes, ignoring
the organized handling of business,
that chaos results, This chaos is
caused by the actions of the class,
not the officers, who cannot operate
without our support.

In conclusion, we would like to

thank the, class officers for their

effective representation of the

class of ’68, They have carried

out their responsibility in every
agea of campus life, :

Baiting?

To the Editor:

Re your’ editorial entitled
*tRights’’ in the ‘*College News’’
of March 19, 1965 -- you have
several uncomplimentary com-
‘ments to make about the memorial
assembly called on Bryn Mawr
Campus about the death of Rev.
Reeb. You talk about the ‘‘Dis-

turbing minority ... ardent agita-.

tors ... (who) promote more vio-
lent action ...’’

‘However, nowhere in your news-
paper do you report whatwasSAID
by these “ardent agitators.’’ You
do not even report that this meeting
was even held. This kind of
(probably unintentional) baiting,

without ‘accurate accounts of what

was said and in what context itwas
said, is unforgivable when found
in a respectable newspaper.

This editoriak may be areaction
to the rather intense and- vocal
liberalism of some of your so-
styled ‘‘not the most innocent...
ardent agitators,’’ on the campus.
Or it may be simply an attempt to
take a safe stand. Of course,
you do not want to disturb your
readers by wholeheartedly en-
dorsing demonstrations and re-
quests that Federal Troops be sent
to Alabama. This is- admittedly a
radical approach,

Students Are Marching Again

by Marion Scoon
Mysterious messages have ap-
peared lately all over campus.
They generally read, ‘March On
Washington to End The War in

Vietnam,” or **Literature on Viet-
nam Here,” or *‘Sign Up For Bus.”’
What is the MEANING of all this?

The answer is simple; The Na-
tional Students for a democratic
Society (SDS), in cooperation with



persions upon conscious agitators
(who incidentally are much safer
than non-conscious agitators, who
simply explode in passionate
monologue and are impossible
to talk sensibly with) without pre-
senting their statements to your
readers.

Irresponsible? _

To the Editors:

Probably the first mass meeting
of its sort since the time’of the
Suffragette movement was held
on the Bryn Mawr campus on
Friday, March 12, Over one
hundred people came including
several professors. Few events
here attract that many people, but
there was no article about it in
THE COLLEGE NEWS of March 19.

The only mention of the meet-
ings was in an editorial entitled
**Progress.’’ This piece said that
**... a disturbing minority, not
the most innocent of whom were
ARDENT AGITATORS, seemed to
treat the gathering as an excuse
to promote MORE VIOLENT AC-
TION ...%’ (emphasis is ours)
We were there and we neither
saw any ‘‘ardent agitators’’ nor
heard any attempts to promote
*‘more violent action.’’? Without
an article reporting the events,
it is impossible for us to know
to what the editorial refers. We
feel it misrepresents the gather-
ing. We resent, as we are sure
the others who were there do,
the irresponsibility of THE COL-
LEGE NEWS on this matter.

Varied Techniques, Tone
Offered in Lowell Reading

by Karen Durbin

Eminent American poet and
playwright Robert Lowell gave
Bryn Mawr one of its most en-
joyable evenings of the year with
a reading from his works Monday
night in Goodhart.

' Mr. Lowell read with effective
dramatic technique from five of
his volumes of poetry, inter-
spersed with candid and frequently
humorous commentary.

Mr. Lowell’s chronological pre-
sentation and enlightening com-
ments not only on the individual
poems but on his attitudes as a
poet at the time of each volume
lent the reading a progressive
unity and gave his audience the
extraordinary feeling of personal
insight into the poet’s creative ex-/
perience.

From LORDWEARY’S CASTLE,
which won the Pulitzer Prize in
1946, Mr. Lowell read ‘‘Christmas
Eve Under Hooker’s Statue,’’ and
two poems based on incidents in
the life of Jonathan Edwards, ‘* Af-
ter the Surprising Conversions”’
and ‘‘Mr. Edwards and the Spider.’’
The poems, all written during
World War Il, reflect moods of
desolation and bitterness, the last
ending on a note of despair. .

This mood was sustained in
the next selection, ‘‘Her Dead
Brother’? taken from MILLS OF
THE KAVANAUGHS. The ‘poem,
a dramatic narrative about war
and incest, considers the themes
of decadence and destruction and
was one of the most effective in
the program.

Mr. Lowell followed with two
Italian love poems, Leopardi’s
**Sylvia’’ and Montale’s ‘‘Dora
Markus,’’ from IMITATIONS, his
book of translations from French,

German, Italian, Greek and Rus-

Across campus telegram forms
are posted requesting Senator Ful-
bright to hold open hearings on
Viet Nam because **The American
people and their government must
hear all sides of an issue of such
gravity.’? We could not agree more!

- Yet why does the SDS, which should

make available such information,
present the government policy only
one time to Bryn Mawr (when
President Johnson’s short state-
ment of policy was piped into the
Teach-In at Swarthmore), whereas
it has flooded the campus with
pamphlets and speakers criticizing
the government policy?

The telegram speaks ofa *‘small
group of men’? who make policy
decisions in a ‘‘secretive man-
ner;’”? how secretive are a group
of men who publish their findings
and their policy and spend a large
amount of their valuable time
speaking to interested groups all
over the country? They have even
devoted much time in their recent
press releases to answering di-

rectly the published criticisms of

their policy, (See especially ‘‘ An-
swers to Criticisms of United
States—Policy in» Viet Nam con-
tained in Harvard-Radcliffe May
2nd Committee’s Critique on the
US White Paper,’’ April 19, 1965).

Having not only given attention
to the views of the SDS, but also
having sought information present-
ing the government’s side, we feel
that there are several problems in
communication between some of
the people of the US and their
government, If advantage were
taken of the information publicly
offered by the State Department,
questions and criticisms would in-
deed be answered. We are de-
lighted to see that the government
material recently made available
in Taylor Hall is being read.

As an example of this lack of
communication: Mr. Pepper last
week spoke admiringly of Senator
Greuning’s condemnation of our
violation of the 1954 Geneva
Agreements. He neglected to note
that neither the United States nor
the Republic of Viet Nam had ever
signed the accords,

The problem is exemplified
particularly in the petition pre-
sented to Congress by the March
on Washington, It says, ‘*You cur-
rently have at your disposal many
schemes, including reconvening
the Geneva Conference, negotia-
tions with the National Liberation
Front in North Viet Nam, im-
mediate withdrawal, and UN super=
vised-eleétions .,. the war must
be brought to a halt.’’

As constantly expressed, the
US government IS trying to bring
the war to an end as soon as
possible, ‘A negotiation that pro-
duces a return to the essentials
of the 1954 accords and thus an
independent and secure South Viet
Nam, would of course be an answer,
indeed THE answer.’ (William P,
Bundy, ‘*Speech to the Washington
Chamber of Commerce,’’ Jan, 23,
1965.)

May I ask the courtesy of your
columns to reply briefly to the
letter from Grace Hamilton, Bar-
bara Mann, and Debby Unger de-
fending the State Department’s in-
terpretation of events in South
Vietnam? Their letter reveals an
unawareness of the role inter-
pretation plays in ‘‘getting the
facts.”’ They write: ‘‘If advan-
tage were taken of the informa-
tion publicly offered by the State
Dept., questions and criticisms
would indeed be answered.’’ But
of course what the State Dept.
offers is not raw ‘‘information’’
(there’s no such thing) but selected,
arranged, interpreted information
which must be subjected to critical
analysis. This is one of the prin-
cipal issues in the current debate,
that our government has deliber-
ately and continuously deluded it-
self. Correspondents and field
officers for the USIA have com-
plained publicly that reports have
systematically (and for years!)
been ‘‘sanitized,’’ each echelon

telling those superior what they
thought they wanted to hear.

Thus it is unwise, for instance,
to assume that the arguments of
such a scholar as Helen Lamb
can be dismissed merely by re-
asserting the government’s posi-
tion. Administration officials are
victims not only of the ‘‘gulli-
bility’? they impute to their
critics, but of self-righteousness
which is leading to an escalation
of self-justification, The pitying
contempt with which criticism has
been dismissed is misdirected and
professors and students have the
right and the duty to say so.

inal Newman and Stephen Leacock,

romantic terms, decries this tenet
in Saying that college provides the
facilities which may be found else-
where (night school, library and
even rooming house) and that its
uniqueness. is~ found only ‘‘in its
aspects as a contentious forum.”’

The terminal note of the Keat-
sian diatribe suggests that itwould
be meet -and-just for society, in
‘looking at itself, to rapidly grasp
the following series of ‘‘’cepts’’;
College is good, but not for. all,
not necessarily at the same period
of life; a diploma is not ‘‘a guar-
antee of anything much’’ nor does
its absence mean that one is con-
demned to meaninglessness for
eternity. One can do otherwise than
go to college.

Since the larger part of the
points presented allude tothe male
difficulties in the. big bad world,
we Bryn Mawrters do not have to
fret, except that the arguments
illustrate that maybe a piece of
parchment doesn’t equal a large
plus sign for achievement in the
great beyond, But, can’t we please
hope that it puts us out of the

the Editor

necessarily reflect the opinion of
THE COLLEGE NEWS. We find the
‘article both confused and exag-
gerated. We could mention many
points which are clearly laughable,
for example: weekly traumatic
conferences are neither weekly nor
traumatic; nor is it necessary to
write 100 pages with three carbons;
nor is an 85 average the universal
criterion for eligibility.

On a more serious note, the cen-
tral point of the article is
illogical and ambiguous. The
author claims that an Honors
project is both rewarding and an
unfair reward. In answer to the
first point, we can only say that
we found our own papers highly
satisfying. With regard to the
second, it is clearly unfeasible that
all students in the College
undertake Honors projects, due in
large measure to the lack of time
on the part of the faculty; for this
reason if for no other, some cri-
terion must. be established. When
students with the minimum ‘re=-



quirement are asked to do Honors,.

there is no pressure on them -
psychological or otherwise - to
accept. The decision rests
entirely on their * own interests,

Both the responsibilities and
the rewards of the Honors program
at Bryn Mawr are made apparent
to all potential Honors students.
We sympathize with the author in
her post-paper depression; how-
ever, we. Still find it impossible
to concur with either argument
put forth in her article.

Meal Exchanges
Eftfected For Fall
In Joint Meeting

Going into effect next September
will be the meal exchange program
between Bryn Mawr and Haver-
ford to facilitate students taking
courses at the opposite school.

The plans are as follows:

1.) A program will be adopted
that will permit students to have
lunch at the school where their
lunch-hour classes are taken,

2.) As far as. possible, a meal-
for-meal system will be adopted
with the Haverford students eat-
ing at those dorms from which
exchanging Bryn Mawr students
are absent.

3.) Access to dining halls will
be on a recognition basis rather
than using tickets or any other
device, The two schools will ex-
change student catalogs for this
purpose,

4,) Financial arrangements for
extra students not included in the
one-for-one exchange will be
worked out between the two
schools.

To provide for guest exchanges
between the colleges, a sign-up
list arrangement has been tenta-
tively adopted, Careful account
will be kept of the effectiveness
of the list, and it will be dis-
continued should any abuse. occur,
The provisions of the plan are
that:

1.) The arrangement willbe kept
only between the two schools.

2.) The list will include only

‘Friday dinners, Saturday lunches

and dinners, and Sunday lunches
and dinners,

3.) The students themselves,
through a committee or other
means, will manage the lists.

4.) Those coming for meals who
do not replace a person dining at
the other school will pay the regu-
lar price.

5.) Neither school: will change
meal hours or Sunday meal pat-
tern to accomodate the exchange.

These plans are a result of a
discussion May 11 among students
and faculty of Bryn Mawr and
Haverford; Popie Johns, Sue’Stan-

And it should be -- for as every
student of political science knows,
an ACTIVE free press is vital to
a healthy democracy. Similarly,
an active use of this column to
express the interests of different
parties is vital to a healthy col-
lege.

Through it you can express your
opinions to all students, to many

.of-whom you would never be able to

talk personally. Even if you-could,
many have been trained to respond
only to the printed word, a common
malady at college. Thus the
“Letters’? become indispensible

In true Ciceronian manner I
pass over the salient effects that
ordering thoughts for anothers’
reading may have on fuzzy think-

In past years the exchange pro-
gram has been monopolized by
visits to Negro schools. These
visits have concentrated as much
upon social conditions as upon
the educational institution itself.

Students whose knowledge of the
Southern Negro extended no far-
ther than what they read in news-
papers were able to understand
if not completely, at least di-
rectly, what it means to be ,a
Negro student in the South. reas

Schools visited ‘include Liv-
ingston College in North Caro-
lina, Tougaloo College in Missis-
sippi, and the tri-college system
of Morehouse, Spellman, andClark
in Atlanta. An exchange was also
held with Sarah Lawrence two
years ago.

This year the exchange com-
mittee hopes to schedule visits
with more diverse schools. There
will, of course, be exchanges with
Negro schools in the South, but
the program should not be limited
strictly to these schools.

St. John’s College in Annapolis,
with its radically different
curriculum might be tried. Per-
haps a visit to a Southern white
college would prove as enlighten-
ing as a visit to a Negro col-
lege. Those who never quite knew
whether or not Radcliffe was really
the-place for them might benefit
from a week in Cambridge.

Which schools are visited de-
pends entirely upon the interest

of the students. Likewise, the suc-_

cess of the program depends upon

» just how strong a desire students

have to leave Bryn Mavr for a
week and see what education can
be elsewhere.

A visit to another college can
be a very vital experience. One
learns as much about her own
school as about the school visited.
The student develops apprecia-
tion for the good, and can criticize
what is not so good in a more
enlightened way. The end result
of an exchange can be a far bet-
ter knowledge of what education
is ak} about,

Anyone interested in organizing
or participating in inter-college
exchanges should contact com-
mittee chairmen Kitty Taylor in

To those who have been’ and

Tom Wolfe’s Amusing KKTFSB

Views Postwar Teenage Culture

by Nanette Holben

A SATURDAY REVIEW er re-
cently suggested that Tom Wolfe’s
KANDY KOLORED TANGERINE
FLAKE STREAMLINE BABY has
the same “diarrhea of words’’ as
the works of his namesake.

Granted the Wolfe of TRIB and
ESQUIRE fame uses occasionally
frustrating esoterica and scatback
phraseology, but -- **Super Scuba-
man!’*? -- he’s entertaining if not
enlightening.

KKTFSB is a series of essay-
like observations On the postwar
teenage culture (‘‘no hung-up old
art history words for these guys’’),

Namely, Wolfe draws ‘‘the new
sensibility -- ‘Baby baby baby
where did our love go’ == ... out
of the vinyl deeps,’’ all the while
poking his prole pen at high society
on some precarious perch.

- Departing from the ‘‘chair-arm-
doilie Vicks Vapo-Rub_ Welt-
anschauung’”’ and the ‘‘tough-but-
wholesome, Mom’s Pie. view of
life,?? Wolfe characterizes the new

- culture, a reaction to the ‘ancient

aristocratic aesthetic.”’

There’s the new architecture --
*fno accident that Las Vegas and
Versailles are the only two archi-
tecturally uniform cities in Wes-
tern history.’? And the new art,
symbolized by baroque custom”
cars such as the KKTFSB itself,
And the new music, championed by

KKTFSB also cites Cassius Clay
(**The Marvelous Mouth’’), Cary
Grant (*‘Loverboy of the Bourgeoi-
sie’’), and CONFIDENTIAL’s pub-
lisher (‘*Purveyor of the Publi¢
Life’’), among its 22 chapters anda
**Metropolitan Sketchbook,’’ acol-
lection. of drawings by Wolfe the
caricaturist.

En. route in his KKTFSB, the
author (PhD Yale) makes athought-
provoking allusion to Haverford
College. ‘*Half of them (Greenwich
Village freakuenters, he means),
like Harry, look like the sort of
kids who. graduated in 1961 from
Haverford, Hamiltonor some other
college of the genre known as
Threadneedle Ivy and went to live
in New York City.’’

Harry Haverford/Hamilton is
also described as having ‘sly
intellectual pigeon-toed libido’
and “‘Searching’’ in a second-hand
bookstore for ‘‘a girl in therewith
pre-Raphaélite hair, black leo-
tards and. a. lambskin, coat,’? So
this is the way to a “Haverford
heart!

KKTFSB is “an” amusing,
perspicacious piece of literature,
though it is hardly a ‘‘Streamlined
Baby’”’ itself. When Wolfe enjoys
one of his phrases or metaphors,
he dehydrates it with overuse.
Notably, ‘‘arteriosclerotic’’ al-

he re-uses the same metaphor,

Two Short Avant-Garde Plays
Pound at Society Hill Audience

by Marcia Ringel

The Society Hill Playhouse is a
small, colorful theatre on South
8th Street, Philadelphia. Its off-
beat lobby -- red ceilings here,
walls of mirror there -- leads up-
stairs to the (250-seat?) theatre
proper. The stage is a fair-sized
proscenium arrangement, some-
what difficult to see because the
seats are not sufficiently graded,

Like little theatres elsewhere,
the Playhouse squeezes amofhg
garages and grocery stores in an
area not conducive towaiting alone
for a taxi. The location is as bold
as the plays chosen for the Play-
house’s sixth season, which began
last evening with LeRgi Jones’
‘¢Dutchman’? and Arthur Kopit’s
‘Chamber Music.’’

In the already grand tradition of
pedantic absurd drama, these two
belligerent avant-garde shorties
pound and pound, the first with
lengthy polemic and the second
literally with a mallet (supposedly
a gavel). This is hard to take at one
sitting, particularly for an audience
relatively fresh to such furious
stuff.

Jones spares us little in histale
uw a brief subway encounter be-
tween a young Negro man and a
young white woman of questionable
morals. We are treated to Racial
Conflict in no uncertain terms but
can forgive blatancy because, by
God, that’s the way Jones wanted
to say his say.

The playbill calls ‘*Dutchman’”’
an ‘Agit-Prop’” (agitation and
propaganda) play, comparable in
stature and statement to the social
declarations of Clifford Odets’
plays during the depression. The
current racial crisis, of course,

has bred its own pamphleteers..

Jones’ stark drama convinces -as

a pafnphlet: convinces: we recog-.

nize the cause and the bias, and
judge the verbal craftsmanship

—

from there,
The verdict is Almost Convinc-
ing. ‘*‘Dutchman’s’’ leads, Patricia

' Powers and Melvin Outlaw, deliver

lines in many kinds of language --
gutter, formal, casual -- with some
kind of élan. Physically, the two
are well cast. Miss Powers also
moves and laughs admirably. The
production as a whole is disap-

«-pointingly unscarring, due in part

to the static situation (Two People
Sit in a Subway and Talk Acidly)
and in part to a backdrop of poor
acting by others on the subway.
Arthur Kopit’s ‘‘Chamber Mu-
sic’’ is neither so witty nor so
pointed as his ‘*Oh Dad, Poor
Dad, Mamma’s Hung You in the
Closet ‘and I’m Feelin’ So Sad.’
The play with the more wieldy
title is a slapdash little item in
which ladies claiming to be Amelia
Earhart, Gertrude Stein, et al
make merry at a ‘**committee
meeting’? in a mental institution
(thus, presumably, the ‘chamber’?
of the title). ‘2
Nothing about this production of
the Kopit play is outstanding; no

actress notable. The set is ade-.

quate, the costumes acceptable.
Once the ladies have made their
first entrances en costume, both
play and performance grow tedious.

It is clear that neither produc-
tion last night was extraordinary.
On the other hand, resident theatre
on a grand scale is a relatively
new and exciting thing in this
country. Such companies as the
Society Hill Playhouse are neces-
Sary as a beginning. This season,
the Playhouse has assumed. man-

a serious legal penalty which will
probably be meted out considering
the present intolerance toward
persons opposed to the war,

In any case, Jerry Dickinson’s
actions are very different because
he is opposing the whole system of
the draft, rather than this or any
other war. He has made it clear
that he understands the probability.
of receiving a jail sentence and is
willing to go to jail,

The COLLEGE NEWS dismisses
opposition to the war in Vietnam
and Dickinson’s position without
any argument, It cavalierly refuses
to say whether such actions are
for a just cause, Certainly, that
determination seriously affects the
validity of these kinds of protests.

The editorial poses this issue

as part of the larger question of
‘the validity of civil disobedience
and confuses this tactic with riot-
ing in Los Angeles, The connection
between the two is an unreal one,
since the nature of 2 riot is one
of chaotic leaderless unsophisti-
cated protest by persons who see
no means of possible redress for
their problems. The use of civil
disobedience in this country is.
found under very different circum-
stances, :

The United States government
has enunciated the doctrine of a
citizen’s responsibility to disobey
the orders of his government when
those orders are felt tobe morally
repugnant; this was the rationale
for the Nuremburg trials immedi-
ately after World War I, This
is known as the doctrine of a
‘higher law.’’ If Jerry Dickinson
believes the draft is morally
wrong, and if draft card burners
and other protestors against the
war in Vietnam feel the same way
about U.S, policies in Southeast
Asia, it is then their responsi-
bility to disobey the government
which tries to make them do what
is morally repulsive to them."

Thievery

To the Editor:

It could be argued that wardens
are slow to react, since they write
to the problem posed by the Oc-
tober 22nd editorial, ‘‘A Race of
Thieves,’’ in the November 12
issue of the COLLEGE NEWS, but
we do not think that we can be
accused of not taking thievery
seriously or of being ‘‘reluctant
to make an issue of it.’’

We would like to point out for
the information of the editors that
the doughnut thievery last spring
in Pembroke was in no way ignored.

to apologize to the hall manager,
Miss Ferguson, for the inconven-
ience caused the kitchen, and to

The students involved were asked

THE EDITOR|

pay the full cost of the breakfast
doughnuts,

However, that’s simply for the
record, More important is the
whole problem of “raising the
issue of thievery’ or, for that
matter, any other ‘‘issue’’ con-
cerned with a student in her rela-
tion to other students in the hall.
We are troubled at times, as we
know many students ‘are, by the
attitude of indifference that sur-
rounds the perennial problems in-
volved in hall life. With some
students, if an ‘‘issue’’ is not
affecting them personally, it is
most difficult to arouse their ac-
tive concern or even interest.

Is it not necessary for each
hall to review periodically the
basic attitudes underlying success-
ful communal living and the re-
sponsibilities that are an integral
part of it? It would then be possible
to consider ‘‘issues,’’ when they
arise, against a common social
framework, thought through and
agreed upon by the membersof the
hall, :

The fasting of students and fac-

/ ulty members of Bryn Mawr and

Haverford Colleges who wish to
draw attention to the suffering of
the people of Vietnam is a method
of expressing deep concern, both
about the situation in Southeast
Asia and about the lack of know-
ledge and interest shown by the
American people, particularly stu-
dents._at_ Bryn Mawr and Haver-
ford.

The main goal of the fast is con-
structive: as the Haverford state-
ment says, ‘*By showing our con-
cern in this way, we hope to arouse
intense and thoughtful discussion |

_about the war and about ways of

changing the conditions which make
this war possible.’’ Self-education
and increased personal awareness
are emphasized, as well as con-
tacting people who have not pre-
viously considered the basic is-
sues of the war.

The fast will begin on the first
Thursday of second semester, and
it is proposed that the participants
will drink fruit juice for eight days.
However, each individual will de-
cide ‘what length of time is ap-
propriate for him, and anyone
may join on whatever partial basis
he sees fit.

Discussions will be held each
day of the fast, with discussion
leaders presenting various points
of view. These meétings will be
open to everyone: ‘‘Our purpose is
to further discussion among our-
selves and with others.’’

Faculty members who signed

vised by several doctors about
the medical effects to. be expecte
‘ed. The general feeling was that
eight days of just fruit juice and
water (and coffee or tea for some)
would not lead to any serious
problems for a healthy person.
This-enabled the students to con-
tinue attenuing classes and tokeep
acadenfic ~~ commitments: “Thé
greatest danger, according to Dr.
Arthur Evans, a 1942 Haverford
alumnus -now in Denver, comes
at the end of a fast. when one
breaks it too quickly, Therefore,
all the fasters have been warned
not to consume three’ cheese-
burgers, a chocolate malt dnd two
orders of Frenchfries at the Comet
at 12:01 Friday morning,

The vrange juice was bought
by each participant at Bryn Mawr
and served in the Inn, The price
was about 40¢ a day, At Haver-
ford, the college provided several
varieties of juice free of charge.
This is indicative of the differ-
ing attitudes of the two colleges.
From the beginning, the Bryn Mawr
administration refused to take a
stand one way or the other, Bryn
as such. wasn’t
in‘ any way involved with any part
of the tast. The Haverford ad-
ministration, on the other hand,
felt it had a duty to the health
of its students. To this end, Dean
Lyons had planned to notify the
parents of each faster what his
son was intending to do. However
this was never done.

Mr. Oppenheimer inthe Sociolo-
gv Department at Bryn Mavr cir-
culated a statement among the
faculty similar to the students’
one, There were six signers who
agreed to fast for one day. Two
others agreed in principle but
wouldn’t fast. There are also four
professors at Haverford who are
fasting the full eight days,

Although releases were sent to
newspapers and radio
stations in the area, as well as
to the wire services, there was
practically no advance publicity.
During the eight days however,
the MAIN LINE TIMES, MAIN LINE
CHRONICLE, PHILADELPHIA IN-
QUIRER, THE NEW YORK TIMES,
the SDS sponsored NEW LEFT
NOTES, and WIBG and other radio
stations all made notice of it.
The CHRONICLE had the story
most confused of them all. Stu-
dents who were fasting were ‘*hun-
gerniks’’? being led by Father Por-
teus of Ardmore, who is connect-
ed with the Student Christian Move-
ment on the two campuses, _,.

On February 8, THE NEW YORK
TIMES printed an article about the
fast. They quoted a portion of
the statement: ‘*We are suspicious
of a ‘peace offensive’ which on
the one hand ends the bombing
on North Vietnam, an aggressive
and unjust action in the first place,
and on the other hand maintains
the high draft rate, increases troop
and materiel strength in South
Vietnam, continues indiscriminate
saturation bombing, poisoning of
crops and chemical warfare

against villages ...’’
Students fasting were often ask-

ed why they chose this method.
For one thing, it shows that they
were serious. No one can accuse
the protesters of having done it
‘‘just for kicks,’? Dr. Evans felt
that the fast would be an ‘‘ex-
periment with Truth,” with empha-
sis on the self-sensitization and
personal identification with suffer-
ing of ‘*thuman beings that do
suffer becauSe of our and others’
lack of awareness, concernor car-
ing.’’ Actually the reasons for each
individual were probably more di-
verse: partly to see if they could
do it, to show strength of resolve,
and to indicate the degree of
caring.

There will be a general evale-..
uation session at~7:00 p.m; Fri-
day night in Haverford’s Common
Room, Anyone who would like to
contribute or just listen is in-
vited.

St. Leonard’s is a half-way house

Rhoads Farm Hit by Progress, Juniors Win H
Bows to Highway Construction

. Progress, in the form of a new
highway, means that Rhoads Farm,
owned by the college, will be

‘cut in half,

The Mid-County Expressway,
commonly known as the Blue Route,
will go directly through the farm
between the hill and creek, The
road comes from the Industrial
Highway in Chester and goes to
King of Prussia, It will take two
years to build the highway and
construction will start as soon as
the state is able to obtain all the
necessary properties. Probably
only three houses will be torn
down since most of the road runs
through undeveloped land. Barring
legal difficulties, officials es-
timate that work will start this
year.

The farm was part of the es-
tate left to the college by Charles
J. Rhoads, former chairman ofthe
board of trustees, upon his death
in 1956, Rhoads Hall was named
for his father, James E. Rhoads,
M. D., first president of Bryn
Mawr.

For the past ten years, a farm-
er has rented the larger house
and the land while a faculty mem-
ber rents the smaller houses. The
college planned no use for the
farm, said Miss McBride, because
of the highway. But the land might
have been good for faculty hous-
ing.

comprise the farm is an apple.

Talk On Cubism

Mr. Rosenblum, the author of
*‘Cubism and Twentieth-Century
Art,” will be speaking about a
new aspect in the study of cubism,
that of the lettering which occurs
in many paintings. It has been
generally assumed that these let-
ters were simply part of the de-
sign of the painting, or copied
from the objects painted, and that
they had no specific meaning in
relation to the rest of the paint-
ing. Rosenblum feels.that there is
a definite relationship to the mean-
ing of the piece of art.

The lecture will take place in
the Art Lecture Room in the Li-
brary at 8:30 p.m,

Rhoads farm has always been
open to students for picnics, cook-
outs, hikes, and bicycle rides.
There is one outdoor fireplace.
The land also contains a stream
and a red-painted bridge. Certain-
ly students will be able to use
the land again this spring. The
farm is about ten minutes away
by cars : e

Miss McBride said that the col-

— But °King of Kings’ Is Still°66

The NEW YORK TIMES is caus-

that controversy by reviewing last

Haverford.

An annual contest, Class Night
consists of four original half-
hour productions, one from each

Student Works Featured
At Erdman Art Festival

The current student art show in
Erdman Hall marks a pleasant
innovation, upon the quiet stone of
Erdman’s. entryway. Kahn built
Erdman with the ‘‘flow of life’? in
mind; as many have pointed out,
the crystallized castle background
lends a perfect. and non-conflicting
setting for the more colorful and
life-like additions--the various
Persian rugs, the furniture, the
moving people. And now the tem-
porary addition of the art show
‘adds itself to this theme.

The Grand Opening (and it was
grand) Sunday afternoon set thle
tone of the idea behind the art
display. A small Bach-Teleman
ensemble with harpsichord began
the afternoon with several pieces
from their repertoire of early
music. They played from one of
Erdman’s much-envied ‘‘balconies
befote the sky light’’which face
centrally towards each wing of the
hall. Later the Bryn Mawr-Haver-
ford Renaissance choir sang(much
appreciating the stone-lent acous-
tics). Tea was served at 4:00 p.m.

The Art Show is sponsored by

Mr. Becker ocasiondlly writes
of a lady friend of his who fancies
herself a bridge player. There
are many bad players in this
world, but Sylvia is something |
special. She makes mistakes that
are not only improbable, but ab-
solutely impossible.

Nevertheless, Sylvia has what
might be called a saving grace.
Every once in a while she dreams
up some exotic bid or play that
works like a charm anddevastates
the opposition.

In this particular hand, Sylvia
was sitting East, defending against
a perfectly straightforward three
no trump contract. Her partner, a
fellow by. the name of Kelly, led
out his king of hearts, and when
this held, followed it with the queen.
The queen also held, so he led
still a third heart.

The question of whether Sylvia
should discard a club or a spade
suddenly became academic when
she calmly and_unhesitatingly
dropped her singleton ace of dia-
monds on the heart trick.

At this point Kelly lived up to
his name. His face turned bright
green, and shortly thereafter, a
livid purple. In his chivalrous
‘attempt to avoid shouting ata lady,
all the colors of the rainbow slowly
paraded across his face. As Mr.
Becker describes it, ‘‘his mouth
kept opening and closing as if,
he were trying to say something --
but no words came out. He was
struck, speechless,’’

Play of the hand was ever.tually
completed, all the while in dead
silence. Luckfly South had only
eight tricks and: was down one on ~
the contract. ee

Oh-yes, one more thing: if Sylvia
had made any other discard, South
wouid have made four no trump.

Yale Mixer Full of Surprises
For BMC and Charlie the Cop

by Cookie Poplin

Anyone with enough enthusiasm
to get up 6 o’clock Sunday morning
might have seen a strange and
pathetic sight--at the doors of each
dorm a small shivering band of
girls stumbling over the steps and
blinking sleepily in the blue-gray
fog of early morning,

These were the triumphant ad-
venturers returnedfrom Yale, try-
ing to figure out some ingenious
scheme for getting back into the
nice warm dorm and a soft bed:
It is strange to travel 200 miles
and be stopped at your own front
door.

The Yale trip, in fact, was full
of strange experiences. For one
thing, none of the accidents an-
ticipated on the way up occurred--
no flat tires, no breakdowns, no
one left behind in the restaurant,
Thus the 30-odd girls arrived in
front -of the service entrance of
Davenport College an hour early.
Like’“good scouts, however, Yale
men are always prepared, and the
girls were escorted back through.

_ the _main entrance of the-master’s «

house to a most elegant cocktail
party with the swim team from
Leverett House, Harvard Univer-
sity. The Harvard boys accepted

the girls happily as part of the.

unrivaled hospitality of Yale.

About an hour later the Bryn
Mawr girls went on to the main
commons room and dining room,
exchangjng the Harvard swimmers
for genuine Yalies and the charm-
ing intimacy of the cocktail party
for a really lavish dinner, com-
plete with a chef carving roast
beef in the high-ceilinged, candle-
lit dining room and music playing
somewhat less than softly in the
background,

At 8:30 the mixer . began in
earnest and..to the surprise of
several freshmen who were rely-
ing complacently on assurances
that at Yale the ratio was always
five to one (boys to girls), huge
groups of girls converged on
Davenport from all over the east-

Whichever the old adage says, you

you can look forward to living on

the ‘*bland’’ diet.

I can’t completely condemn the
Infirmary staff, because I over-
heard one of the nurses complain-

received. For example it is shock-

to receive half a glass,

It?s a sorry state of affairs

Although I am not representing
Bryn Mawy College per se at this
convocation in San Francisco, I

all comments and chal-
lenges in regards to my remarks,
To clarify a. bit: I do feel that
Bryn Mawr offers the possibility
for obtaining what I conceive of as
being an education, and I think
that its failures can be explained
by the attitudes of the students
more than by any other factor.

_ However, just because Bryn Mawr

is more intellectual and more
democratic than most. other
schools does not mean that it is
beyond analysis and improvement.
My speech continues:
‘¢Furthermore, a system which
makes grades the criteria for the

evaluation of a student’s per-

formance creates pressures and
goals which are. irrelevant to the
educational process, The pass-fail
method would, on the other hand,
insure that the emphasis be on
the student’s own desire to do well,
and most students, I believe, would
respond with their best if such a
system were in effect.

**Education must become a posi-
tive, meaningful, and flexible pro-
cess, not limited to the halls of
a university but extended into every
aspect of society. There isa world
beyond the college, and it is the
student’s responsibility to himself
for his education to participate in
its cultural, intellectual and
political activity, and it is the
administration’s responsibility to

Students have a unique position in
society, for they live in a com-

’ munity whose principle dedication

is the development of thought and
ideas, yet they are free from the
social restraints which might incur
in earning a living or being the
head of a family. It is, there-
fore, incumbent upon the student to

‘analyze radically and idealisti-

cally, the structure of both the
campus and the society beyond and
to make demands for their im-
provement.

‘(Democratization and intel-
lectualization of the campus will
not come about suddenly and will
require hard work at the grass-
roots level, The present university
has the potential to realize these
goals but first students must be
made aware that the myths of non-
participation, non- involvement,
privatism, the passive education,
and liberalism for liberalism’s
sake are, after all, only myths,
fallible and challengeable ... An
education, which is to be both
meaningful and positive, can
only be brought about through
outspoken and continuous. ques-
tioning, discussion, controversy,
and the presentation of alternatives
by faculty, administration, and es-
pecially students until the demand
for change is a general one, and
the analysis begins again. The
development of new theories of
education then becomes part of
the educative process, and the
whole college community would be
involved in realizing their respon-
sibilities to each other, to society,

Raphael Discusses Vietnam War,

Analyzes American Involvement

by Alan Raphael Haverford, °66

The extensive American involvement in South
Viet Nam dates from the years 1954-56, when the
U.S. gave strong support to the maintenance of the
Diem regime. The crucial event in this period was
the refusal of Diem to agree to the nationwide
elections called for by the Geneva agreements, The
provision for elections was the chief political
element of the accords which resulted in the
cessation of hostilities in Indochina.

The extent to which the U.S, was responsible
for the decision not to holdelections, or acquiesced
in it, is important in determining the extent of U.S,
responsibility for the recent history of Viet Nam.
The forces opposed to the U.S, in Viet Nain may
judge the sincerity of U.S, advocacy of negotiations
leading ‘to free elections by its actions in regard
to the elections called for as a result of the
negotiations at Geneva in 1954.

To understand Diem’s refusal to hold the elec-
tions, it is necessary to understand several factors:
the: military and political position in Viet Nam in
1954; the responsibilities of the major powers under
the Geneva agreements; and the effect of internal
conditions within the two zones of Viet Nam on the
national political situation.

When the Geneva Conference met in mid-1954,
the military situation in Indochina was most un-
favorable to the French. The Viet Minh controlled
most of Viet Nam and parts of Laos and Camb@dia;
the French had far too few troope and had lost a
great number of officers.

The conferees issued two statements. One was a
cessation of hostilities agreement between the
French Union forces and the Viet Minh. The other,
the Final Declaration of the Geneva Conference,
was affirmed by all the conferees except the U.S.,
which issued a separate declaration. The co-

chairmen of the conference were the foreign miniS- °

ters of Great Britain and the U.S.S.R., Eden and
Molotov, respectively.
The Delegation of the State of Viet Nam protested
- that the French High Command controlled the Viet-
namese troops only through the power of Chief of
State Bao Dai and that the French had no right to
negotiate. The Bao Dai government had no real
power, having been created as an attempt by the
French to divide the Vietnamese nationalist move-
ment.

The Geneva agreements provided for a cease-
fire, a regrouping of the opposing military forces —
_in separate zones, and the temporary partition of ©

the country until elections for a national govern-
ment took place,
The SmI PTE ot He Avision is made

clear in both of the documents issued. The final
declaration of the conference states this most
clearly: ‘‘... the military demarcation line is
provisional and should not in any way be inter-
preted as constituting a political or territorial
boundary.’’

In regard to elections, the cease-fire agreement
provides that, pending elections, the Viet Minh in
the north and the French in the south shall be in
charge of civil administration. The final declaration
indicates the timetable for elections: *‘... general
elections shall be heldin July 1956 under the super -
‘vision of an international commission composed of
representatives of the Member States of the Inter-
national Supervisory Commission (Canada, India
and Poland were the members; Indiawas the chair-
man), referred to in the agreement on the cessation
of hostilities. Consultations will be held on this
subject between the competent representative
authorities of the two zones from 20 July 1955
onwards.’? The decision to hold the elections two
years after the agreements were signedwas caused
by French and British insistence on a delay; the
Viet Minh had wanted elections in six months.

The accords were enthusiastically praised by
the Viet Minh, China, and the U.S.S.R. The U.S,
refused to associate itself with the final declara-
tion on the grounds that it had not been a bel-
ligerent in the war, but pledged not to violate the
agreements nor to approve of any violation.

Eden praised the agreements as ‘‘about the best
bargain France and the Associated States could
have made.’ Eden also criticized the U.S, opposi-
tion to the final declaration, claiming that ‘‘since
Dulles had been at least as responsible as our-
selves for calling-the Geneva Conference, this did
not seem to me reasonable.’’

The State of Viet Nam objected to the division
of the country and criticized the French for fixing
the date of the nation-wide elections. The latter
part of this criticism indicates that the State of
Viet Nam made no distinction between the two
agreements, since only the final declaration fixed
the date of elections.

The significant developments in the political
situation of Viet Nam in the two years following the
Geneva agreements concern the consolidation of
power by Ho Chi Minh and the Viet: Minh in the
north, and Ngo Dinh Diem in the south. Since the
Viet Minh already controlled most of the north and
were aided by the prestige of their leader Ho Chi
Minh; the transition to their total control was_
relatively easy. _- =

In the south, the political situation was unclear.

Inn Kitchen

A few weeks ago, I went to the
student kitchen in the College Inn
to bake .a birthday cake, and as I
entered the kitchen I nearly col-
lapsed. Filthy dishes and cooking
pans were scattered among piles
of garbage which had been left on
the counters. The new stove which
was purchased to replace the stove
that was burned out by careless-
ness was not working. It too had
suffered from improper use and
a failure to wipe off inches of
grease which had accumulated on
its surface and insides.

Needless to say, the cake didnot
turn out as well as it might have.

This kitchen is our kitchen, and
I refuse to believe that Bryn Mawr
students could have such a lack of
consideration for others. The
thought of eating food cooked in
this kitchen is enough to make
anyone sick.

I have also heard that pots,
cooking utensils, and dishes have
been disappearing from the kitchen
all- year, and that often food left
in the refrigerator is missing the
next day. What is most shocking
is that a stove had to be replaced
because grease left on it had caused
it to burn out, and that the new
stove is being’ treated in the same
manner.

I am thoroughly disgusted with
the lack of responsibility towards
the Inn kitchen and will make no
further attempts to cook food in
it until I feel sure that more care
is being taken towards its im-
provement.

It is a pity that Dennis Carson knows so little

which he ought to be informed about for its own

enough responsibility to that audience to know what
he is talking about, But his. ignorance on this sub-

apparent indifference to the great suffering that
exists in the world and to the nature of a society
that permits or causes much of that suffering, This
indifference was clearly shown in Mr, Carson’s

I am writing this letter to the

Blu Comet Closes
At Midnight Hour
To BMC Dismay

The Blu Comet, not-so-fashion-
able watering place of Bryn Mawr,
Haverford and Villanova students,
as well as truck drivers passing
through, changed hands this sum-
mer and has instituted new hours.
It will be open from 6 a.m, till
12 midnight every day. Formerly,
it was open 24 hours a day, but
closed on Mondays,

Mr. Tony Diakopos, the new
owner who also works there until
6 p.m, or so, explained that the
time change was prompted by a
‘lot of trouble with students at
late hours.’’ He cited broken win-
dows and a court case arising
out of problems last year. He told
this reporter that although there
were some ‘‘very nice students’?
there were also some ‘‘very, very
bad’? ones,

Reactions on the Bryn Mawr
campus have been almost unani-
mously those of dismay, Walking
in to the Comet (or Vomit as it
is sometimes called) around 12:30
has become a strong habit for
many Mawrters, Stopping there
on the way back from Haverford at
1:30 is also somewhat of a tradi-
tion, Then the Haverfordians often
go in on their way back from
Bryn Mawr after 2a,m, There have
been rumblings of petitions and
protests at the curtailing of these
pleasures,

Diakopos is not absolutely im-
movable with respect to the new
hours. He knows he will be losing
business as well as friends, Also
to be taken into consideration is a
15¢ hamburger Hot Shoppe opening
across the street, However, he
seems to be sure that he wants to
keep the new hours for some time
yet, if not permanently,

One other change has been noted
at the Comet, The behind-the-
counter team of Paul and Charlie
has been broken, Charlie has left
and is reputedly working some-
where else down the Main Line,

totally new college experience, I
must admit, won out in the end,

I have not lightly dismissed the
inconvenience which I have caused
as a result of the new election
which will have to be held, and I
want to apologize for this, I am
certain that a very qualified suc-
cessor will be elected, and to
whomever she may be, the best of
luck,

I have been at Michigan since
August 24, and a ‘‘new college
experience’ I AM by all means
having. To even begin to describe
here the differences between

Merion Hall feels that a thanks is

That means that we will not be

HUAC Demands Papers
From Haverford, Stetler

At the beginning of August, the
House Unamerican Activities
Committee subpoenaed = certain
written documents from Haverford
College, The documents contained
information reputedly linking the
college and students to two rebel
supportive organizations in South
Viet Nam, the U.S.A, May Second
Movement and the National
Liberation Front,

The subpoena, addressed to
President Hugh Borton, was re-
ceived in his absence by Provost
Louis Green, chairman of the As-
tronomy Department at Haverford,
In effect, the subpoena called for
the college to deliver to the com-
mittee two basic kinds of infor-

mation,

The first kind of document re-
quired by the committee was any
correspondence between the col-
lege as an official institution and
the May Second Movement Com-
mittee, or any such corres-
pondence initiated or received by
the college from the National Lib-
eration Front group, The College,
in its reply to the committee,
stated that no such information
had passed between the college
or either of these organizations,

The second kind of document
demanded by the subpoena was a

The Athletic Association hopes
that the NEWS can help publicize
its efforts to start a folk dance‘
group. Previous attempts have fail-

were unable to locate each other.

The proposed group will dance
one evening a week, perhaps Fri-

Both BMC and Haverford students
are welcome, The. group’s pur-
poses will be social as well as
recreational,

Beginners are invited to join.
Experienced dancefs willing to

Clarification

Dear Lola,

Perhaps you could arrange to
have a correction in the nextissue
of the COLLEGE NEWS on the
hockey article that has appeared
in the recent issue: 1, Miss Yea-
ger is in charge of hockey and
-Miss Plowman merely came in at
Miss Yeager’s request, to offer
some of her: experience to the
hockey group, 2, I believe the
statement attributed to Miss Plow-
man that emphysema could be
cured is a serious error. We
would all like this corrected, It
was merely a case of emphysema
where the individual underwent
training and seemingly had im-
proved a great deal,

Director of Physical Education

To the Editor:

The door of the cottage was un-
locked and several cheerful teen-
age girls greeted us and took our
coats, A Swarthmore boy, who
was the cottage leader, escorted us
downstairs where games were in
progress, Despite the cheerful
faces, I was a bit ill-at-ease
and expected resentment, But im-
mediately a group of girls sur-
rounded me, asking my name and
drawing me into the game,

My new friends became my per-
sonal escorts upstairs when we
divided into’ groups to teach lan-
guages, folk-dancing, guitar-play-
ing, and knitting, I was in charge
of the last, but spent most of my
time answering eager questions
about dorm life, my major, and
my home town, Before I had even
BEGUN “Ne learn names, answer
questions OR teach knitting, itwas
time to go. Iwas made to promise
to come back, but that was really
unnecessary since I was already
eager to return,

Thus I was introduced to the
world of ‘‘delinquent’’ girls
through the Sleighton Farms pro- i
ject sponsored by League, In this

project, Bryn Mawr and Swarth-
more students serve as a link
to the outside world for the girls,
We help to remind them that they
are important individuals behind
the label thrust upon them, and
(by our presence) we help teach
them simple ways to behave in
society. Each small group of us
is assigned to a specific cottage
where we conduct activities as
varied as ‘‘drama nights’? and tut-
orial sessions,

Always there are awkward mo-
ments when the girls talk about
their home life or their problems,
But always, too, we are rewarded
by little things--like the refresh-
ments we know were carefully
prepared for us,

This year we plan to expand
the project by including Haver-
ford students as volunteers and by
bringing the girls out to events on
campus, A picnic at Swarthmore
last year was just a beginning
to the possible off-school trips.

The group goes every other
week,.and volunteers havea choice
of one of two days of the week
they wish to go, If you would
like to join us, please contact

Campus-Wide Referendum
Planned on Constitution

Students will elect a special
committee to supervise the work
of altering the Self-Gov consti-
tution during this Constitutional
Revision Year,

An autonomous body, the Con-
stitutional Revision Committee
will contain two representatives
from each dormitory. These
members will be chosen at elec-
tions conducted by hall presidents
within the next two weeks,

Both Self-Gov and the campus

Bevinda Nordnha

Undergrad Scholar

Bevinda Nordnha of Mombasa,
Kenya has been chosen this year’s
Undergrad Scholar. She is one of
three new African students on cam-
pus, Bevinda originally had planned
to enter a British university and
had taken two years of post-high
school study in order to prepare
for it. But then she heard about
Bryn Mawr and decided to come
here instead.

As a result of her extra study,
she has entered as a sophomore.
She is planning to study English,

at large will submit all sugges-
tions for revision to the commit-
tee for consideration, The com-
mittee will then attempt to
formulate all prospective reforms
into a yes-no ballot form.

These issues will be voted upon
in a campus-wide referendum, Any
questions too complex for a yes-
no vote will be presented to Legis-
lature for additional analysis,

The COLLEGE NEWS will pre-
sent a series of articles by Execu-
tive Board members, not to pre-
sent proposals, but to discuss the
background of the present consti-
tution, the reasons behind the rules
set forth in it, the issues that led
up to their formulation, and ‘‘re-
current’? issues (the honor sys-
tem, etc.),

Before the Revision Committee
begins its main work, Self-Gov
will post in the dorms lists of
clarifications of terms used in the
constitution with full explanations,
These terms can be put to an all-
campus vote for revision, if a
petition signed by 10% of the stu-
dent body is submitted, Self-Gov
hopes to get all revision done by
Christmas, so that the new con-
stitution is ready by ssssanied 1967.



‘What ABOUT Calamity Jane?’
Asks Hygiene Lecture Audience

by Emily McDermott

C. V. Wedgewood, as Mr. Berthoff recently re-
lated, had an interesting theory of education: although
he censored his sons’ reading (because, as he said,
boys’ minds are open to corruptive suggestion),
he let his daughters read anything at all, on the theory
that girls need all the help they can get in this
world, It is seemingly on this principle that Bryn
Mawr (duly concerned with our health, education,
and welfare) yearly hustles us off to the wildly
raunchy hygiene lectures.

This year, this series of ‘‘lecture-discussions”’
includes two lectures on mental health and two on
sex hygiene (apparently catering to the college
community) and, finally, one of ‘‘pressing health
problems,” The first of the series -- a lecture on
‘¢Personality Development’? given by Dr. Margaret
Temeles -- offers little hope that (for once) the
hygiene lectures will live up to the Wedgewoodian
objective.

To give Dr. Temeles her due, it. would be next
to. impossible to give. .a good lecture on, the topic
‘at hand, The information dealt with is so basic
that a listener would be lucky to pick up one piece
of new information, however useless. The deal with
a child’s progress through oral, anal, and phallic
(‘*that’s P-H-a...’’) stages is something less than
stimulating, especially when the audience listens

spgetty Ona ‘ * oy ~

with scarcely-concealed condescension. But then,
who can blame them when they have to sit through
such inane assertions as: ‘‘Somehow, sometime, a
little girl becomes aware that somebody has some-
thing that she hasn’t??’

The inanity of the lecture was relieved only by the
annoyance occasioned by outdated psychological
theories, misconstruction of the Oedipus myth, and
aimless (and worthless) speculations on the alter-
nate roles of heredity and environment, The one
or two statements which promised to be interesting
were left dangling. For instance, the totally
irrelevant (and evidently rhetorical) question: ‘‘And
what ABOUT Calamity Jane?’ was left unanswered--
much to the audience’s dismay. And what exactly IS
a Jiminy Cricket complex?

All in all, the prospect of sitting through four
more lectures on a par with the first one boggles
the mind. Yet the alternative (or is it additional?)
reading~list bodes no better. Does anyone really

expect us to read books with titles like “What: a a
“Means to Grow Up,” ‘The Happy Family,” and —

‘*youth Looks at Cancer?’

And so, one last word to the hygiene people:
In the room the women come and go =
Talking of phacts of libido...

HURRY UP, PLEASE, IT’S TIME.

Concerning Calamity Jane --
Emily McDermott’s article in the
last issue of the NEWS mentioned
‘outdated psychological theories”
as the topic of Dr. Temeles’ hy-
giene lecture, The lecture was a
straight-forward if not very com-
prehensive presentation of Freud’s
theory of personality structure and
development. In that psychoanaly-
tic theory, strictly speaking,
hasn’t progressed much beyond
Freud, and in that this theory
still exerts a profound influence,
it could hardly be called ‘‘out-
dated.”? On the other hand, there
certainly are a number of more
modern theories which could
equally well have been discussed
in a lecture on a topic so broad
as ‘‘Personality.’’? It was unfor-
tunate (and perhaps negligent) that
Dr. Temeles didn’t at least mén-
tion the existence of alternate

“theories” of personality, choosing

instead to present Freud’s theory
not as theory but as fact.

This kind of omission, however,
is bound to come up in a lecture
series which purports to cover
the topics of mental health, sex,
and pressing health problems in
all of five lectures. And we all
know that increasing the num-
ber of hygiene lectures would be
unbearaole as well as unreason-
able,

It was my impression that the
audience reaction was based more
on lack of comprehension than on
‘¢condescension.” Either way, if
the quality of the information im-
parted in the hygiene program
cannot be improved, the usefulness
and assumed value of the whole
requirement is thrown into ser-
ious doubt,

Of Constitution

by Jane Janover,
Self-Gov President

Last week’s NEWS article on
Constitutional Revision discussed
changes in the existing Constitu-

lishing a Constitutionak Revision
Committee, In order to clarify
that article I will try to further
explain both types of revision,

Changes in the wording of the
present Constitution will be posted
in the halls this week, These are
not changes in meaning, They are
only changes of expression, clari-
fication procedure, and the re-
ordering of provisions, They have
been done in order to facilitate
the actual revision of meaning
and amendment of the Constitu-
tion,

This revision and amendment
will be carried out in the follow-
ing manner, First, each hall will
elect two representatives from
sophomore, junior, or senior
classes, These representatives
constitute the Revision Committee.
This committee is completely
autonomous, electing its own
president, vice president, and sec-
retary, and establishing its own
rules of procedure, Its members
are to go through the Constitution
and propose changes at thelr own
discretion,

had heard a call, ‘It is my wish,’’
he said generously, ‘‘to provide
bagels everywhere they are

With the help of Mitch Freed-
man, who secured the purchasing
contract with the bakery (using
a heavy Yiddish accent on the
phone to get them for considerably
less than wholesale); Vonnie Beng-
lian, publicity; and Pete Batzell,

he calls a grass roots business,
Their philosophy is that bagels
actually belong in the grass roots
because they have a history long-

Alaskan Anthropological Finds
«Give Clues to Eskimo Culture

by Kit Bakke

Anthropology teacher Herbert
Alexander, his wife, and a 1966
graduate’ of Bryn Mawr Vicki
Graftstrom spent three weeks this
summer in the northern Brooks,
Range in the Arctic areas of
Alaska, From Mr, Alexander’s
descriptions, it sounds as if they
were racing around digging up arti-
facts, throwing them in sacks,
moving up river, stopping and dig-
ging some more, then taking time
out to shoot caribou and catch
trout before moving on again.

This July was the third time
Mr. Alexander has been to Alaska,
and he is already looking forward
to going back next summer. The
possibilities for anthropological
research there seem to be un-
limited. He wants to take about
six students with him. next time.
They don’t have to be anthropology
majors, he said; rather it is im-
“portant that theybe able to ‘‘put
up with the peculiar conditions of
the Arctic.’? These conditions
amount to millions of mosquitoes,
the midnight sun, and cold mist
and rain every morning, as well
as the usual conditions that go
with camping out for a summer,

The digging that went on this
summer was amazingly fruitful.
They found over 40 sites in the
three weeks; as opposed to only
15 during the whole summer of
1962. Mr. Alexander said that some
nights they would set up camp, get
the fire going and then discover
that they were sitting on top of
another site.

The artifacts they found were
around 5000 years old, They are
very tiny and distinctive: one-inch
arrows, beautifully made; engrav=-
ing tools . called burins; and
various kinds of microblades. It
is difficult to tell if these are
from a culture related to the
present day Eskimo, partly be-
cause of the age of the artifacts,
and partly because of the lack of
a good definition of ‘‘Eskimo.”’

He does think that they belong
to the Denbigh Flint Culture, rem-
mants of which have been found
around the Seward Penninsula in
western Alaska, and in western
Canada. These discoveries in the
Brooks Range, ‘then, provide a tie-
in between these earlier sites.

The origin of these people is not
clearly known. But because of some
very similar. Arrowheads and
burins Mr. Alexander has found in
Texas; which are dated at 10,000
years, he thinks that it is possible
that the Denbigh people followed
the game up north as the ice from
the last Ice Age receded.

There were also some more
recent objects uncovered: heated
metal tools, pieces of snowshoes
and part of an old guitar: This
is significant because this area
around Galbraith Lake and the
Atigun River had always been con-
sidered completely unoccupied and
has never been fully explored. In
fact, Mr. Alexander’s team didn’t
see one other person the whole
time they were there.

The ‘morning fog and rain pre-
cluded much work before 10 or 11
a.m, When they did get going though,
they didn’t stop for lunch until
evening, and then worked until two
the next morning. This was per-
fectly feasible, because the sun

They lived off dried foods that
they brought in’ by plane, one cari-
bou and one sheép they shot, and
many large lake trout. The small-
est of these trout was two feet
long; and once they cast 20 times
and caught fish on all but one cast.
The largest was 33 inches, They
also saw grizzly bears, moose and
wolves. These were all relatively
tame because they had never seen
people before and didn’t know
enough to be scared,

financed by the University Museum
of the University of Pennsylvania
and the Society of Sigma Xi. Mr.
Alexander is now working on a
grant application for money for next

photographer Robert Flaherty in
1922, will be shown in the Biology
Lecture Room, Monday, October

The film is sponsored by the
Anthropology Club, which requests
a donation of $25. This is a
‘‘beautiful documentary” of the
communal life of the Hudson Bay
Eskimos, according to Andrea
Lurie, co-chairman of the Anthro
Club, It is about their struggle
for existence, and should be of
interest not only to anthropology
students, but to those interested
in ethnography and film-making

mine, There should have been
more, and more effective pub-

who signed their names, These
tasks require organizational ef-
ficiency, however, and the new
Social Committee is still in the
planning stage,

Second, I am now most reluc-
tant to begin to consider setting
up any more trips to other schools,
This week alone, Swarthmore, Yale
and Columbia called with invita-
tions, and frankly I was at a loss
whether to accept or just to say
that Bryn Mawr has no interest
in any trip away from this cam-
pus,

Third, and most important, this
signing up and then not showing
up has naturally got to stop, No
one is forcing you to sign up,
but if you do sign up, you are
committed to go,

Three cheers for the COLLEGE
NEWS ‘‘Meaning of an Education
at BMC”? supplement of Oct. 14!
The special interviews were above
and beyond the call of reportorial
or editorial duty and helped add
to the excitement of the Educa-
tional Goals Committee series,

The editorial concerning the

Curriculum Committee shows the
need for more discussion of just
what the scope and purposes of
the organization are, As stated
in the Freshman Handbooks, the
committee’s ‘‘beat’? includes all
areas of academic life not in-
cluded in the academic honor sy-
stem, Curriculum Committee, if
successful, is at once a liaison
with the Faculty Curriculum Com-
mittee; a receptacle for student
views (be they gripes or sugges-
tions); an orginator of suggestions;
and a source .of information for
students, ;

The Curriculum Committee has
at this point one active subdivision,
Educational Goals Committee, We
hope to add a student vocational
subcommittee, which would work
with the Bureau of Recommenda-
tions in keeping students informed
of job possibilities. Another pos-
sible addition is a calendar com-
mittee to work with the faculty
groups, v

I have been asked about my
‘conception of Curriculum Com-
mittee’? -- I feel, however, that
the time for conceptions is past,
and that this is a year for action.
The Educational Goals Committee
series made it clear that the stu-
dents are tired of mumbling com-
plaints and, having presented con-
crete problems and concrete sug-
gestions, they expect to see some-
thing done, especially about the
large classes, :

Our immediate goal is to cor-
relate the material gathered in the
recent discussions and propose
some solutions for the problems,
which will be presented in the
report which Nancy Gellman men-
tioned in her NEWS article last
issue, Alsothe Faculty Curriculum
Committee is tackling the large
classes problem, and we intend
to work with them as much as
possible so that a solution satis-
factory to administration, students
and budget may be reached,

I--feel that Educational Goals
series also pointed out the need
for a concise statement of just
what is. meant by a liberal arts

education at Bryn Mawr, as
opposed. to one at any other
school -- something that could

be put in the catalog so that

students know more of what to

expect when .they join the col-
lege community,

Indignation

To the Editor:

We can only express _in-
dignation and annoyance about
last week’s letter to this column
concerning the so-called un-
successful mixer, The writer of
that letter did a great deal of
harm to all concerned, as well
as revealed her own sense of

pseudo-contrition at the end. We

should like to make four points
concerning that mixer:

1) No one should have to pay
for negating a sign-up to a dance,
Dances are not our religion,

2) The loss of $200 just could
not simply have .been caused by
13 people, Even if 13 more people
went, 19 boys still had been date-
less, We are not responsible
for making all 50°boys happy, but
just those for whom there are
girls. Un-even matches occur all
the time for social events,

3) Perhaps some girls did not
realize it was Hillel’s mixer, If"
,,
cn1966-10-28.txt,"['Letters to the Editor ', 'To the Editor:', 'To the Editor:']","

Regarding the school calendar
decision:

It seems somewhat ridiculous
to me that the Bryn Mawr ad-
ministration was forced to decide
on an issue of such importance,
especially this year with the ex-
perimental schedule, without dis-
cussing it with the parties in-
volved, namely the students and
faculty, when the catalyst was
Haverford’s athletic schedule,

It reminds me of a situgtion
current in some high schools which
start and end at the hour depending
on when the bus company is willing
to run, Are both schools, avowedly
academic formerly, turning to the
lighter side of life? Should 1000

_.Bryn Mawr students be inconven-

ienced for the comparatively few
Haverford sports participants?
Wouldn’t it be better for the Hav-
/erford athletic schedule to be ar-

‘ranged: separately and those in-

volved..return: to soho! earlier if
necessary? re
A clarification of both colleges’
attitude towards academic pursuits
is needed,
A Disinterested Senior

‘Snide Students’

To the Editor:

‘I am writing in response to
the letter ironically entitled
‘‘Indignation’’? signed by ‘‘Two In-
terested Spectators,’’ Interested
hah! Two Snide. Students would be
a more appropriate signature. I
would like to object to three of
their belligerently assumed points.

1) No one is paying who negated
her sign-up. Rather, those people
who failed to negate their sign-ups
are those who are required topay.

This is not such a fantastic de-
mand. When the Social Chair-
man is. planning a function at
any men’s school, except Haver-
ford, the specific number
of those attending is important
if only with regard to trans-
portation. Bryn Mawr students,
if they hope to have a-Social
Chairman that can make any plans
at all, have to cooperate with
her; that is, they have to realize
that there is some responsibility
involved in signing up for dances.
No one is saying that ‘‘dances are
ee. our religion.’”? Rather, those
planning these dances deserve the
common courtesy that is required
in any social situation,

4

2) The fact that the mixer was
with the Hillel group at Princeton
was written on the sign-up sheet.
If this is a reason for some not
wanting to attend, it would be
easy enough to contact Mary Little
and have their names ‘‘stricken
from the record.”

3) The tone of the point denoted
4.,a,.is definitely offensive. The
Hillel group is a part of Princeton
as the SCM group is a part of
Bryn Mawr. That is not to say
that Hillel is a distinguishable
entity, separate from Princeton
University. or that SCM is
similarly separate from Bryn
Mawr.

These Two Snide Students actual-
ly appear to be indigant about
the fact that the mixer was a
Hillel-Princeton mixer, not, as
they would say, a ‘‘simply’
Princeton. mixer; that they had
misread the sign-up sheet; that
they were: being required to pay
for a mixer that they, in their
faintest dreams, would never think
of attending. SOUR GRAPES!

H’ford Students Council Proposes
To Change Overnight Restrictions

The Haverford student body met
Tuesday morning to vote on the
Students’ Council’s proposed
changes in the Honor System.

Although four of the five amend-
ments were scheduled for voting,
Haverford managed to pass only
two during the hour. Voting on
the other three will take place at
Collection November 22.

The amendments, as explained
at the plenary session, are meant
to change the tone of, the Honor
System, not to change what goes
on-in practice. Said Council presi-
dent Mike Bratman, the changes
actually describe better what goes
on now.

For example, the clause which
lists the judicial power of the Stu-
dents’ Association to be ‘‘to try
the case, render the verdict and
impose the sentence,’? was voted
to read ‘‘to discuss the matter in
question, and respond with the
course of action which it be-
lieves most beneficial to the in-
dividual and the other members of
the community.’’

The second amendment passed
Tuesday concerns the ,reporting of
offenders, and again specifies
‘discussion’? of the said offense,
and emphasizes the _ responsi-
bilities of the students aware of
the possible conflict with the honor
system.

The third amendment, which now
reads, “Each student shall be re-

“sponsible for his proper conduct

in entertaining women guests on
campus,’’ is up for this change:
‘‘Each student shall be respon-
sible for his proper conduct with
respect to women guests and the
individuals comprising the Haver-
ford College community.’’

The ‘‘Any Act’? clause, now read-
ing ‘‘Any act which shows dis-
respect for a woman guest and/or
lack of regard for the college com-
munity shall be considered a
violation of the Honor System’? is
restated, ‘‘Any act which fails. to
show proper respect for women
guests and/or individuals who com-
prise the Haverford College com-
munity shall be brought to the at-
tention of a member of Students’
Council.”’

Under the present Honor Sys-

tem,-a student is permitted to en- |

tertain women guests on campus
at any time except between 2 a.m.
and 7:30 a.m. Monday through Fri-

aom. and 7:30 a.m. Saturday and
Sunday mornings. A student is not
to entertain women guests in
dormitory rooms or the adjacent
halls between 7:30 a.m. and 9:00
a.m.

The proposed change reads,
‘‘Specific time limits are incon-
sistent with the principle of in-
dividual responsibility inherent in
the Honor System. However, keep-
ing a4 woman guest on campus over-
night may fail to show proper re-
spect for the woman guest or the
college community. Therefore, any
student’ who keeps a woman guest
on campus overnight shall bring the
matter to the attention of a mem-

day mornings, and between 3:30 ber of Students’ Council.’"

cn1966-11-04.txt,"['Letters to the Editor', 'To the Editor:', 'To the Editor:', 'Letter to the Editor,']","
however, Margaret Levi com-
mented, ‘‘ ,.. many students may
wish to attend another university
just for the experience, and there
is no reason why their -grades
should be taken into consideration
when they wish to return,’’

Considering such responses as
this one, Miss Vermey pointed out
that the criteria for readmission
are ‘‘nof&\§an irrevocable policy’?
and ‘‘open to discussion,’? She
has already written to other Seven
Sisters colleges todetermine their
policies on leaves of absence and
readmissions, and is also looking
into possibilities for junior year
away programs apart from the
Junior Year Abroad system,

Colgate Operates
Calendar System

Under 4-1-4 Plan

One of the most intriguing as-
pects of calendar revision is the
so-called January plan, This has
been alternatively called the Col-
gate or Glickman plan, the
former because Colgate has
adopted it, and the latter because
Mr, Glickman of the Haverford
Political Science Department of-
fered his conception of it
to Bryn Mawr and Haverford stu-
dents twf years ago.

The purpose of a January plan
is to introduce some intellectual
freedom, life and creativity into
the usually dead month of Jan-
dary, This..is done. by. fin-
ishing first semester before

- Christmas vacation, and then not

starting second semester until
February.

Paul Weckstein, a Haverford
transfer from Colgate, has pro-
posed this calendar:

Classes begin: Sept, 12

Thanksgiving: Nov, 23-7

Christmas: Dec, 28 - Jan, 3
Intercession: Jan, 28 - Feb, 1
Spring vacation: March 24 -

April 12

Exams end: May 13 ~
This not only allows for the Jan-
uary plan, but also provides
for practically the same number
of schooldays,

The creativity and freedom
comes with independent work of
some kind, There are several
systems that could be adopted,
but basically it would entail each
student working with a professor
on a project or papar of his
choice,

Bachrach Offers Solution
To Overcrowded Classes

Mr, Bachrach of the Political
Science Department has found one
solution to the crowded classes
problem that is presently .annoy-
ing both students and faculty
members,

His Constitutional. Law Class
has about 40 members, He con-
siders this far too large’ for his
purposes, It is a ‘‘nigh level class,
but just too large,’’? ne said, Up
to this point the class has been
considering the recent Supreme
Court decisions which have been
revolutionizing the area of crim-
inal justice,

So now he has sent half the
class out into the field in five
groups of three or four students,
They are doing research at

-Penn’s baw. Library, and. then

spending time in Philadelphia
courtrooms, district attorneys’
offices, and.police stations, learn-
ing the exact nature of the
impact of the Supreme Court
decisions, Each of the five groups
is working on a specific topic-

forcement _ practices,

by Janet Oppenheim

On Monday night, October 31, a small number of
Bryn Mawr. students. and faculty members heard
two alarming predictions: that within ten years
members of the clergy would be abandoning their
calling in droves, and that the racial inequities
of our society could only be solved by machine
guns and concentration camps for Negroes.

The grim, realistic speaker was the Reverend
Layton Zimmer, and his address, entitled ‘‘God
Bless Slums and Police Brutality,’ was sponsored
by the Alliance for Political Affairs and the Inter-
faith Association.

Behind his lengthy title of ‘‘Urban Missioner of
the Protestant Episcopal Church and Special Con-
sultant to the Bishop on Areas of Social Tension’’
lies the Reverend’s demanding, frustrating, im-
possible job. Dealing with ‘gangs, junkies, pros-
titutes,’? the poor and discriminated against of
North and South Philadelphia, Mr. Zimmer must
try to arouse the white community, must attempt

to open communications between haves and have-

nots, between whites and blacks.

So far, he feels he has accumplished nothing.

He describes his task as a ‘‘bridge-building job
with both shores moving further apart.’’ To his
despair, both shores are building obstructions
agains< any means of spanning the gap.
* Reverend Zimmer was a parish priest for ten
years in Wilmington, Delaware, and then inSwarth-
more before starting his job two years ago under
the new bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Penn-
sylvania. His job, which he terms ‘‘experimental,”’
brings him into the lives of have-nots as. friend
and sympathizer.

He participates as a protester in picket lines
and serves as a minister for many who have had
no contacts with the church. He must bury a
child, killed by the falling ceiling of a slum tene-
ment. He must perform the marriage ceremony
for the unwed parents of four or five children.
He can bring no promises or program money with
him. Less than 50% of his expenses are paid by
the diocese. His job runs on money from the bis-
hop’s discretionary funds.

White power is, according to the Reverend,
the dominant factor in the western world, if not
in the whole world, behind racial injustice. He
knows it is the factor which allowed him to reach
his present position. Mr. Zimmer attended the
University of William and Mary when it was closed
to Negroes and then entered an Episcopal Seminary
which had separate and terribly unequal facilities
for them. When he left his position of curate in
Wilmington, a Negro was allowed to replace him
only with the unequivocal stipulation that his term
of office last just one year. Clearly, the Church
does not offer a solution to the problems of dis-
crimination and prejudice.

This failure by the Church brought Mr. Zimmer
to his prophecy for the fate of clergymen. Today,
he finds them-a group of ‘‘defensive, demoralized,
hostile, morally stricken’? men. They are com-
mitted to an ideal which has not, in the words of
Stokely Carmichael, ‘‘been able to deal with the
blasphemy that the poor deserve what they get.’’

Yet to break from the meaningless ideals would
mean to break from security, respectability. Cler-
gymen hear their WASP congregations object to
spending tax money on slum improvement. Opposi-

lapse of their supports, and will, in Mr. Zim-
mer’s belief, reach the breaking point within
the next ten years.

We cannot count on the Church, then, for re-
lease from our tremendous problems. Nor does
Mr. Zimmer think the answer lies in political
structures. He emphasized that the bridgebuild-
ing must start with us, At the same time, however,
the basic problem originates in ourselves. Most of
us want to keep doors shut to black people, the
Reverend said. The black man knows how much the
white man despises him, and the white man does not.
We do not realize that we are involved in an attitude
that allows us to be something which we would
vehemently deny to be.

Mr. Zimmer is convinced that civil rights bills
are passed, projects are undertaken, not out of the
whites’ fear of black riots. After all, as President
Jéhnson said, whites form 90% of the population
of the United States. No programs of social re-
form are undertaken in order to keep the white
man from coming face to face with his own atti-
tude.

Is there any validity, therefore, in projects
and programs? Reverend Zimmer says emphati-
cally no. Perhaps they bring some limited material
profit, but that profit ends with the program, when
the participants go back to their hell, What is
worse, the participants have been allowed to see,
no matter how briefly, some aspect of that life
which they will never be able to attain. The result-
ing bitterness and frustration has led many Negroes
to accept help only from blacks. They feel cer-
tain that whites give gifts only to manipulate the
blacks in some way.

The meaning of Black Power lies in this rejec-
tion of the white man’s aid. For the average Negro,
hope for life in an integrated community is dead,
They don’t want to waste their time in hating and
fighting the whites. They want to take what is their
due and just leave. Mr. Zimmer is not afraid that
the Negro will topple white society, but he is
desperately afraid that the Negro will give that
society the opportunity to use the evil within it,

It is this evil that could lead to the construc-
tion of concentration camps for Negroes.and the
placement of machine guns in the streets by police
forces. The Reverend believes that we are little
more than one breath away from that state now.

Is there any hope at all for future integration;
for a harmonious, balanced black-white society?
If separation of the two peoples is not only sin,
but death, as Mr. Zimmer believes it to be,
aren’t we faced with sin and death on both sides?
Why, if he feels. that the Church is useless in the,
struggle, does the Reverend continue to serve it?
How can he say, ‘‘If I only hoped in man, I would »
go home and kill myself,’’ and still maintain his:
efforts? ‘

He answers that he enjoys the battle, that he
enjoys challenging the terrifying situation with his
own abilities. He must do what he can, and he
did when he removed his daughter from a private
school because he considered private education a
separating factor in society. His daughter now at-
tends a public school with 90% Negro students.

Not just isolated individuals, but everyone must
do what lies within his abilities. Above all, we
must not sit at home and merely worry over the
state of affairs. Whatever hope can be found in
the Reverend’s message, and there was precious
little, must be found in his refusal to accept the
situation as it now stands, and in his search to
open channels of contact in an almost totally. un-
communicating society.

Faculty Members Offer Opinions



by Kathy Murphey
Alliance recently proposed that
a voting student member or several
members be admitted to the faculty
Calendar Committee. In a series
of interviews, the faculty response
to this proposal was varied.

Mr, Dudden, a History pro-
fessor, and one of the two faculty
members on the Calendar Com-
mittee, claimed that the issue of
student. representation involves
more’ than the calendar, He felt
the whole question of a student
share in the government of college
affairs should be considered,

Mr, Dudden said he would be
in favor of a movement in the
direction of more student partici-
pation in the college community,
Students. have good ideas now from
which the faculty doesn’t benefit,
Many of these ideas could be used
in solving practical problems,

Mr, Dudden hoped that graduate
students as well asallfour classes
of undergraduates would join stu-
dent committees which would take
positions “on college policy, Thus
a broad and continuous base for,
student interest in college affairs
could be created,

Mr. Berliner, a chemistry pro-
fessor and a member of the
Calendar: Committee, thought that
the calendar is a college and a
faculty affair. It involves issues
like financial matters, research
time, and cooperation with Haver-
ford which are not student con-
cerns.

Mr. Berliner said he was will-
ing to listen to student opinion.
Yet he felt there was no coherent
opinion on issues such as the ‘‘lanie
duck’? period. He thought that there
was no ideal calendar which would
satisfy everyone.

Mr. Berliner was opposed to
having a voting student member on
the Caiendar : Committee, He did
not approve of anon-voting, listen-
ing representative either. He
felt the faculty committee might
meet occasionally with a separate
committee of students to hear their
opinions.

To the Editor:

It is now 10:55 a.m. (Sunday).
The door to the Library was just
unlocked; it was supposed to be
opened at 10:00 a.m. The purpose
of opening the Library early on
Sunday was to provide more time
to use the Reserve Room, Has it
been opened? No. Provisions were
made to have somebody work in
the Reserve Room this morning
and was she notified that it would
not be opened? No. (And the same
thing happened last week.)

Inconvenience? Yes, not only for
her but the many others who had
fond hopes of imbibing the treas-

‘ures of knowledge to be found within

the tomes imprisoned within the
Reserve Room. One would think
that those who went to the trouble
to get permission to open the
Library early would have the
integrity to follow. the e job through
to completion.

If you will allow me, I wish to
give a reply to two articles in
the last issue of the NEWS (Nov-
ember 18, 1966). They are the edi-
torial ‘‘Key to Sign-Outs”’ and the
letter to the editor ‘‘Room Keys.”’

The editorial suggests that with
keys, ‘‘ ... if a girl planned to
be out past 2 a.m., she should

‘sign out until 6:30 a.m. at which
time the dorms should be open...’?
That is very good. The hall presi-
dents and all the people who check
on sign-outs retire at 2:30 a.m.
The girl who signed -out till 6:30

was in a crash at3:15a.m.andthis ~

was not known by the college. At
6:30 a.m. many people are still
sleeping or are atleast trying todo
some honest work before 8 a.m.
There is breakfast and the day
begins. There is probably no dis-



Freedom of the Press :

Mr, DuBoff, in discussing his book AMERICA’S VIETNAM: POLICY,
THE STRATEGY OF DECEPTION (see p. 5), makes it very clear that
the U.S. press is being ‘‘intimidated,’’ ‘‘browbeaten,”? and generally
managed by the Johnson administration. These are strong words, but
even if they are only half-true, it is a dangerous situation.

Freedom of the press is guaranteed in: this country by the first
amendment to the Constitution. No nation whose people are making
the political choices can exist without complete ‘and honest dissemina-
tion of information. Correct decisions simply cannot be made unless all
the objective alternatives are known.

The coverage of the Vietnam war seems'to be denying the people the
knowledge needed to make the right evaluations and decisions. Mr. Du-
Boff pointed out that this is partly because the reporters themselves
do not really understand the country or the issues and so are unable to
ask the right questions, But the weight of the blame must fall on the
administration’s refusal to clarify its goals or release adequate facts
about what is going on. From what is known now about the ‘‘peace of-
fensive’”? of last winter, it appears that the troika of Johnson, McNam-
ara and Rusk are essentially ignoring the alternative of sincere diplo-
matic negotiation as a means of ending the war. They want a military
victory and it can be argued from their statements that they are will-
ing to commit genocide to get it.

In.order to wage a successful war, it is necessary to have the people
behind the government’s position. Johnson is very aware of this, and
he is using the press tosomeextentas a propaganda machine to mobilize
public support.

As apart.of the U.S, press community, albeit a small one, the NEWS
objects to this kind of behavior, Management and censorship of the news
is wholly incompatible with principles of liberty and fairness to which
we theoretically subscribe, A free press is not the only ingredient nec-
essary for a viable democracy, but it is most certainly an extremely
important. one. We thus would like to go on record as opposing the
Johnsonian tactics which are pointed out in Mr. DuBoff’s book and which
are impinging on the freedom of the American press,

Funds for Art

The damage done to Florence by the recent floods means some
irreparable losses to the world of art, but Bryn Mawr College can
do its part to save what is salvageable. Mrs. Hanson notes happily
that more than $600 was donated by Bryn Mawr people prior to Thanks-
giving, and the tallying of the post-Thanksgiving gifts to date is still
under way. Further contributions are more than welcome.

Since funds are so urgently needed, we suggest to Arts Council that
it organize a Fast for Florence, organized the same as the NSA
Freedom Fasts. Saga would probably be more than willing to cooper-
ate, and, no doubt, so would a majority of the student body.

Whatever the fund-raising measures, do try to help out.

_ The New Trend

The responses to the NEWS editorial on dorm keys turn out to be
both pro and con, but despite any, criticisms of the concept of the
system, we do not retract our proposal, but urge once more that the
Constitutional Revision Committee give it serious thought. The sug-
gestions put forth in the letter from the group of seniors (‘‘Dorm
Keys’’) are especially valuable, particularly the point that the keys
be stamped ‘‘illegal to duplicate.”

If the system has worked out at other women’s institutions, as
well as co-ed ones (and the trend toward the use of dorm keys seems
to be... spreading), there is no reason why it should not work at Bryn
Mawr. We-can see no reason why it would conflict with the philosophy
of Self-Gov; instead we repeat that it would serve to enhance the honor
system..

A constant and close reader of

the COLLEGE NEWS, I often find .

myself reacting strongly but si-
lently to the happenings at Bryn
Mawr. I am delighted therefore,
at your editorial invitation tocom-
ment upon the proposed rule change
with respect to sign-outs and keys.
I hasten herewith to accept your
invitation.

I strongly oppose any liberali-
zation of existing curfew regula-
tions, In fact, I think regulations
‘should be made more restrictive,
I would like to see a week-
night curfew of midnight, no
‘secret sign-outs’, and no
over-night leaves without parental
knowledge and approval,

Some of the premises upon which
the above conclusions are based
are the following. First, big enough
is not synonymous with old enough.
Adolescence is a stage of physical
and psychological growth occupy-
ing a span of approximately ten
years from age 11 or 12 to age
21° or 22. It cannot be hastened
or telescoped without some sac-
rifice in quality of the end prod-
uct, some degree of dwarfing or
blunting or distortion. The more
complex and freer the society, the
more highly educated and evolved
the individual must become if he
is ‘to fit himself into it. One can
grow’ old without growing up un-
less one takes care to include all
of the growing-up steps and mea-
sures.’

A second premise is_ that
stretching and strenuous exercise
of the intellect is one means, and
for complete human fulfillment an
essential means, of growing up.
Hence, the residential college
where one can be a full-time stu-

~ commuting, of the mundane world,
and of earning a living. To dilute
the intensity of being a full-time
student by being half-time occu- ~
games isa dis-

fun and
the

if



. ; Seeeoes the rates drop, Sr

is being expended. College, like
life, does not guarantee happiness.
Happiness is achieved not by pur-
suit, but comes as a by-product
of more strenuous and demanding
pursuits.

A third premise is that parents
have an obligation to guide their
young into fruitful adulthood. I
do not abdicate my responsibility
when my daughter goes off’ to
college and I expect the college,
in my physical absence, to stand
in loco parentis. I do not delegate
my authority to my daughter or to
her peers. I know I shall be
called upon, and I hope to be; if
and when there is any threat to
her health of welfare, and I wish
to have something to say about
prevention. ‘

A fourth premise is that’ the
college is a private educational
facility which makes its. special
privileges and immunities avail-
able to those who wish to make
use of them. The iation be-
tween college and student is vol-
untary on both sides, with re-
sponsibilities and obligations, as
well as privileges, a part of the
contract. If the responsibilities
and obligations are found to be
onerous or incompatible with one’s
personal convictions, one can with-
draw from the association.

A fifth premise is that girls,
albeit sublimely wonderful are dif-
ferent from boys. Their sexual
aims and needs are less physical,
more emotional, and slower to
evolve. At the same time their
vulnerability is immeasurably
greater. ‘Pills’? are not without
hazard (malaise, weight gain, im-
pairment of liver function). Abor-
tion is risky, difficult to come by
and carries~a potential for life-
long physical and emotional scars.

My final premise is that the
college’s greatest obligation is to
its youngest, weakest, and most
vulnerable members. The impul-
sive, the unknowing, and the un-
tried suffer most from the heady
freedom of the Self-Government
loose regulations. The college isa
community and not a collection of
private individuals. When one per-
son is sacrificed to the new per-
missiveness, all are diminished.

You may disagree with my
premises and conclusions. Per-
haps you are right and Iam wrong.
Let us apply some objective mea-
surements. In the two decades
during which students have been
demanding and receiving progres-
sively greater amounts of personal

suicide, accidental injury, unin-
tended pregnancy, premature mar-
riage, and mental illness, have
risen sharply. My personal ex-
perience in teaching medical stu-
dents (the elite, finished product
of the colleges) reveals a degree
of dependency, bewilderment, and
impreciseness that impedes effec-
tive teaching and learning. More-
over, the dropout rate in American
medical schools has risen steadily
over the past 20 years from 4.5%
to a current 15%.

Those of you whom I know per-
sonally I love and admire, my
daughter above .all. Every day I
learn from you, from your tri-
umphs, your satisfactions, your
failures. What I learn inspires me
not to abdicate in your favor but
to make my contribution to your
growing up years more meaningful
and relevant and useful.

Children and War

To the Editor:

One of the more convenient as-,
pects of modern warfare is that
it can be waged by a people un-
aware of what it is doing. It is
indeed amazing, as Mr. Dudden
pointed out to his History 303
class last week, that we can sit
in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania, go-
ing to school, blessed with the
necessities and even the luxur-
ies of life while 11,000 miles away
our taxes, $100 a year from each
of us as an American citizen, go
to wage a war in which an entire
civilian popufation finds itself in-
extricably involved. I thought I had
become nearly used to this idea,
however, and that the general in-
difference of the American people
to the Vietnamese war could no
longer shock me. But once again
it has,

When I posted in Taylor Hall

last week pictures of injured Viet-
namese children for whom there is
inadequate medical care, I exper-
ienced a response from some stu-
dents which I could neither believe
nor understand. These pictures of
burned children offend us, they
complained. Take them down. They
are in bad taste, and we cannot
sleep at night after looking at them,
they said, Today I found the pic-
_tures of children on the Alliance
bulletin board covered with slips
of white paper. Give us facts and
figures, they said, but do not con-
descend to appeal to our emo-
tions.

It makes no difference to me
in| en to this question what

suppose, to realize the suffering
of the Vietnamese and still argue
that it is necessary. I do not be-
lieve, however, that anyone can
develop a valid opinion about this
war without realizing to some ex-
tent the significance of the means
being used to win it. War is not in
good taste. The thousands of Viet-
namese children with eyelids
burned away by napalm cannot
sleep easily either. Somehow facts
and figures of millions wounded or
thousands dead do not meannearly
as much as the picture of a single
Vietnamese child with the skin
peeling off his back from a war
burn.

Suffering is not measured in
millions or thousands but in many
individual cases. It is only when we
see the meaning of an individual’s
suffering that we can begin to mul-
tiply itinto statistics. Each wound-
ed child does not understand or
even know how many children are
wounded, He understands the war
in Vietnam in terms of his own
suffering. It certainly cannot hurt
us to be exposed to his point of
view on the war.

My purpose in posting those
pictures, however, was not topro-
voke thought but to inspire ac-
tion to remedy in some way what
has been done to these children.
One cannot begin truly to solve a
problem until one has. admitted

-that it exists. Covering the pic-.,

tures will not heal the children’s
wounds, If you are outraged by
those pictures, you should be
equally outraged by the existence
of the untreated wounds, and will-
ing to help us raise money for the
Committee of Responsibility.

I think of what Albert Camus
wrote in THE PLAGUE, ‘‘For the
plague-stricken, their peace of
mind is more important than a
human life ... I have realized
that we all have plague, and I
have lost my peace. And today I
am still trying to find it; still
trying to understand all those
others and not be the mortal ene-
my of anyone. I only know that
one must do what: one can to
cease being plague-stricken.’’ The
war in Vietnam is at least partly
our war; the wounded are at least
partly our responsibility.

She was a _ scholar. of dis-

the more fitting for someone like
Dr. Swindler who embodied those
ideals of scholarship and devoted
service to Bryn Mawr College
that are honored by Faculty and

review of a book or article one
hasn’t read oneself: one can’t be
sure whether one is addressing
oneself to the original author or
to the reviewer. But since you
didn’t tell us how to locate Mr.
Smith’s article, I shall have to
pose my questions to you on the
basis of your account. In any
event, only one query is concerned
with the experiment itself; the
other comments deal with im-
plications which you or Mr. Smith
or both have drawn.

The first question, a double-
barreled one, is for information.
Why should HOUSEWIVES be se-
lected to judge the ‘‘religious in-
tensity’? of the reports of the
theological students who under-
went the Good Friday experiment?
This seems curious scientific pro-
cedure. And of greater interest to
me, how on earth did anyone es-
tablish a criterion of ‘‘religious
intensity’? without begging the
question which so many .of us:
philosophers and theologians find
desperately difficult, an under-
standing of what religion and re-
ligious experience are?

That question leads into two gen-
eral issues which I_ would like to
raise. The first is about the ob-
ject or content of such exper-
iences. You (or Mr. Smith) talk
of ‘experiencing a oneness of the
universe,’’ of a man finding “‘har-
mony with his world,’’ of coming
‘closer to God.’? Leaving aside
the important question , whether

bring on an interesting glow and

vironment. How do I distinguish

the ability of the mind to make a

The letter to the Editor (Feb, 10) from
a Bryn Mawr parent was well written
and raised relevant issues, My reply
is not, perhaps, typical of the thinking
on campus, but I think the letter deserves
better than no response at all, —

I would like to deal with only two, of
the parent’s premises to: show my view-
point, It seems to me his (or her)
argument rests on two of his premises:
(1) that the College has the responsibility
to act to protect all its members, but
that its main concern must be for its
weakest members; (2) that the primary
purpose of Bryn Mawr is the education
of the mind and that other activities are
at best necessary, but unimportant (eating,
sleeping), at worst distracting and dan-
gerous (dates, extra-curric activ-
ities).

In response to the latter, I would
maintain that one of the College’s main

responsibilities is the education of the .

mind, but that if it spends four years
doing only this, it has failed to do what
a good college should and must do in
order to produce truly ‘‘educated’’ women,

Each ofus knows people of high intelligence -
who are so irresponsible-that they need

Recent letters and editorials in
the NEWS about the proposed con-
stitutional -revision, both those
which support the changes and
those which express reservations,
all make the unwarranted assump-
tion that the revisions will bring
about fundamental changes in the
attitudes and behavior of students.
I doubt that they will.

Most of the controversy has been
about the elimination of the cur-
few and the initiation of a ‘‘key
system’’, The hall presidents who
wrote the above letter represent
the concern that without a curfew
people will tend to spend more
time out of the dorm and destroy
what sense of community that there
is there. I think that is highly
unlikely,
under the present system gives
a girl*the option of being out of
the dorm all the time if she wants
to be, and yet overnights aren’t
used extensively during the week.

By eliminating the 2:00 curfew
the proposed rule change elimi-
nates an arbitrary limit, I can-
not imagine that-suddenly large
numbers of people will want to
come in between 2:00 and 8:00. It
is very possible that having no cur-
few will make it easier for a girl
to come in earlier than 2:00, since
that will no longer be a limit
to be pushed toward. :

The hall presidents who wrote
the above letter state that they
are concerned not so much with
specific rules changes, but with
the spirit of ‘isolationism’? of
the individual in which they were
made. [ think they are wrong
in assuming that in giving the in-
dividual the freedom to make
choices, such as when to come in
at night or what to wear on a giv-
en occasion, we are fostering
anarchy. They object to the fact
that under the revised constitution
‘cultimate authority will rest not
with executive board ( a lenient
body always willing to consider
individual circumstances), not with
the hall president, but with the in-
dividual.” | firmly believe that
that is exactly where it should
rest, The role of executive board
should not be to stand over us

Before we even considered
changes, we examined the role of
Self-Gov as our governing body,
and the kind of constitution it should
have. to make it most efficient and .
powerful. Looking at the constitu-

its rules required acts of common
sense, not honor, nor responsibil-

we. consider our community to be
under a social honor system, we
felt the basis of it must lie in
personal responsibility of the in-

It is essential to the success
of any government that the rules
express the will of its members.
Looking at our student body we

The methods used in. the fire
drills on this campus seem to be
defeating the very purpose of their
existence.

It seems to us necessary that
all drills make use of only the
fire escapes, What is the point
of running all the way down the
hall to a wooden staircase which
is likely .to burst into flamés
half way down if not before the
student arrives at it? Fire es-
capes are the fastest and safest
method of leaving one of these
dormitories during a fire, and
the reaction of a student should
be to immediately exit from the
building by way of the fire es-
eape (this reaction should be-
come automatic), We feel that the
use of the staircases should be
abolished in ALL fire drills. Some
dorms do not even have fire es-
capes, and we suggest that the
administration make this a re-
quirement of all buildings on cam-
pus.

We feel that the use of fire ex~
tinguishers in each hall should
not be forbidden as they are at
the moment. Not only do we. ad-
vocate student use of fire equip-
ment, but we consider it vital
that lessons in the use of this
equipment be given at the be-
ginning of each year, How many
students actually know the exact
locations of the local alarms in
their buildings and how to use
them?

Why not investigate the possi-
bility of a more efficient method
of calling in the fire department.
A dime in the mailbox of the hall
fire captain seems a poor sub-
stitute for an alarm system which
would summon the firemen.

Finally, if the. purpose of the
fire drills is to enable the stu-,
dents to save their lives by quickly
fleeing from the buildings, why
are the employees and wardens
not included in the drill? Is the
purpose of this exercise ta save
the student body and allow em-
ployees to perish in the flames?

We suggest that the fire cap-
tains, the administration, and the
fire department meet to discuss
these problems which make the
entire fire drill system a lesson:

whether y’all have ever found

As to your enviable position as

Furthermore, a joint staff would
be more fun and more stimulating.
The result would be a better news-

this move for fear of being sub-

‘*Off-campus’”’ housing is nota
rumor, There are ten seniors
now living in cooperative apart-
ments and the experiment seems
to be working very well. The
truth is, however, that these build-
ings are actually owned by the
college and the students are each
paying five hundred dollars rent
to Bryn Mawr, in lieu of room
and board, ©

The arrangement was planned
as a result of great agitation last
year on the part of some students
for a ‘‘cooperative movement’
allowing students to. live in houses
off-campus and prepare their own
meals,

There are ten seniors living
‘in apartments in the College Inn,
According to one of them the
situation is much better than liv-
ing in a dorm because ‘‘you can
live here and almost ignore the
rest of the campus,” She feels
that it is up to the individuals
as to how much she participates
in campus life, and by the time
she is a senior she knows whom
she wants to see anyway and which
organizations she wants to join.
The greatest advantage of ‘‘off-
campus”? housing seems to be
greater privacy, a ‘flexible
schedule (meals, noise, etc,), and
_ mass institutional living.”

living arrangements of this type

have been instituted at Bryn Mawr,
the college contributed to the pro-
ject by giving the girls in ‘‘Bets-
y-Coed’* a rug for their living
room and some furniture to help
them fill up a“somewhat larger
apartment, i:

When asked if girls living éoft-
campus” were under Self-Gov
rules, Kay replied that as yet
they were all unsure of the rules
but assumed that they were suppos=-
ed to live under the same system
as the rest of the campus (in-re-
spect to curfew, drinking, and
men in the rooms), ‘‘Last year,
Self-Gov told us that we were
still under their rules - and we
believed them, We don’t really
want to hold an orgy over here
anyway ~ it’s sort of boring you
know, ..’?

The interest in cooperative
housing was much greater last
spring when students. thought that

dt -was really. going to be OFF

campus, but when they found out
that it was really ON campus, many
gave up or decided that the pro-
ject was not worth the trouble,

According to Kay, however,
*‘off-campus’’ housing is wonder-
ful and seems to be a good way
to expand the college community
without building new dorms. But
since cooperative housing is!
limited to the number of build-

Now that an effort is being made
to insure better safety procedures
in case of fire, I would like to
bring to your attention a fire ha-
zard I noticed during the Fener:
fire drill in Taylor,
, Ak the soos cf ie bell, On

‘students in class proceeded to exit
from the room, only to discover -
. that the classroom door had to

be opened INTO the room (toward
the oncoming students), Such a
situation could conceivably“ en-
danger the lives of the room’s
occupants, since (1) it takes longer
to. open the door against the on-
coming students, and (2) given a
real fire emergency, the ensuing
panic could cause such a jam-up
at the door as would make it im-
possible to open, Incidentally,
the latter was the case during the
notorious Triangle Fire in New
York at the beginning of this cen-
tury when many lives were need-
‘lessly lost,

Is it, therefore, too much to
ask that the doors in Taylor (and
elsewhere) be re-hinged so that
they open outward into the hall,
facilitating a safer exit?

The locksmith darkly hinted .

that the College felt that

Undergrad Meeting Evaluates
‘67 Freshman Orientation Week

Despite the usual confusion
attending the opening of the col-
lege year, freshman orienta-
tion week was unusually suc-
cessful and well-run,
Undergraduate president Lola
Atwood says with satisfaction.

At the meeting of “the
Undergraduate Association held
at the College Inn on Monday,
it was pointed out that this year
marked the first time in the
history of Bryn Mawr that no
freshman had withdrawn from the

college by the first day after ar-

rival.
Seniors
Debbie Brown, and Patricia
Monnington, who moderated the
meeting, were chairmen of fresh-
man week, Working with them
was a large number of sophomores,

juniors, and seniors, most of whom ©

arrived at Bryn Mawr on Wednes-
day, September 13, to welcome
incoming members of the class of
*?1 the following day. Preparation

Bonnie Cunningham, »

and planning for the event, how-
ever, began last May before
the advent of the summer-vacation,
with the selection of the welcom-
ing committee and the assign-
ment of various tasks such
as the compilation of a freshman
file in each residence hall by
the hall president.

The most important problem
experienced during orientation
week, believed the committee, in-
volved the receiving of those
freshman who arrived before Sep-
tember 14, Many members
of the incoming class, whether
because of distance or other rea-
sons, arrived on campus on

Wednesday, September 13, thus.

creating confusion by appearing
before upperclassmen or the wel-
coming committee had fufly
completed preparations to meet
them. Rooms were not all
in readiness and upperclassmen

‘in many cases were too busy

to be as cordial as they would
have liked.

Taxi Trouble

A weekend away from school can provide a
refreshing change, and local cab companies are
sometimes a little too eager to take advantage
of that fact.

A case in point; two girls ordefed a cab last
Friday from Bryn Mawr Taxi, The driver picked
up a girl from. another dorm, also going to the
airport, and announced that each girl was to pay
$5.50. When the more experienced traveller pro-
tested _. vigorously, _.he ._ changed his mind
: and suddenly lowered the fare to $9.50 for three,
' He called the main office, and finally charged
‘the first two girls $6.50 altogether and the third
girl $5.50 alone, If you call Bryn Mawr Taxi,
-they will tell you that the rates are $5.50
_ for one girl, $7.50 for two, and $8.50 for three.
Further ‘investigation elicited that taxi
rates from here to the airport vary widely, Often-
used Bennett Taxi charges $5.50 for one or two
girls, $7.50 for three and $9.50 for four, Ardmore
Cab Company, Yellow. Cab, and Suburban Cab

More or Less. Trust

To the Editor:

Last week K, D, Pulcipher, public re-
lations man at the Bryn Mawr Trust
Co., offered to explain the Trust’s mo-
tives in denying an account to Mainline
Vietnam Summer, I accepted his invita-
tion to lunch and looked forward to ob-
taining a coherent, concrete statement of
the bank’s general policy, as well as its
position on this particular issue,

His explanation was somewhat vague.

As self-protection, he said, the bank

must demand adequate proof that an in-
dividual is authorized to deposit and
withdraw funds for a given organization,

Mr, Pulcipher’s generalization was fine
as far as it went, buthe was unable and/or
unwilling to discuss the issue in more
specific terms, He had been vacationing
when the incident occurred, He wasn’t
aware of the discussion between the bank
treasurer, Mr, Paul, and Susan Greanoff
in reference to Vietnam Summer’s unusual
pattern of organization, He didn’t know
that Chuck Bresler had supplied Mr, Paul
with any sort of literature concerning the
nature of_the group, In short, Mr, Pul-
cipher pad little or no idea of what was

going on;

One statement, put forth as proof of the
apolitical basis of the bank’s actions, was
indicative of the ‘“‘depth’’ of our discus-
sion: ‘‘I don’t even know if the group
(Vietnam Summer) is North Vietnamese

moment, it is handicapped in every one of
these fields, At the next Undergrad meet-

College Provides. Psychiatric Help;

Where does a Bryn Mawr stu-
dent go with a problem? If peers
and parents offer no help, she
traditionally takes the matter to
a dean. But deans are busy people,
and students tend to be shy if the
problem is anything more per-
sonal than a schedule conflict.

On behalf of the Bryn Mawr

Letters to the Editor

ford College Drama Club, I would
like to extend my apologies to the
reviewer of ‘‘The Taming of the
Shrew’? for subjecting her to such
an unpleasant and fruitless eve-
ning. F

I would also like to point out,
however, that despite the often:

caustic tenor of his verbal holo-—

causts, Alexander Woolcott was
able to metamorphize a fiasco
into a moderately meaningful ex-
perience for both himself and the
theatre companies. A  thought-
ful critical attitude is usually more
rewarding to everyone involved

than a devastatingly negative one. .

Distorted View

To the Editor:
Miss Mary -Laura Gibbs, the
most recent drama critic of Bryn

Mawr and Haverford productions, —

has revedled in her review-a
condescending, if not distorted
view of ‘‘The Taming of the
Shrew.’’

All too eager’ to condemn the

production for not having ‘‘quite.

enough of anything’? she failed to
note an admirable and polished
balance which characterized the
pace and tenor of the play. Her
textual understanding seems ‘‘un-
easily fuzzy’’ as she is surprised
that Petruchio is allowed to over-
come Kate. I may be mistaken, but

. T assumed that this was the gen-

eral idea ... Insofar as interpre-
tation of the material, a realm
in which Miss Gibbs feels there is
an ‘‘apparent lack,’? our critic
may have been too busy thinking
about Mr. Swann’s ‘‘cloying habit
of tossing his hair back’’ to ob-
serve the interpretation presented
in the first mieeting of Kate and
Petruchio; an idea of:.‘‘love at
first sight,’’ obviously not the
only possible interpretation of the
drama, but certainly a plausible
and effective one as it is car-
ried throughout the play.

What she calls ‘‘generally good
timing’? is to me a huge under-
statement. The actors move onand
off stage with a professional ease,
as do they pick up their lines
in a manner that can only be
called extremely well-timed. Thus
what Miss Gibbs calls a half-

hearted performance seems to me
to be a vibrant production.

The purpose of a review, even
on a college campus, is not to
give . unending and inordinate
praise to one’s peers; but at the
same time it should not be used
as a means to discuss frayed
costumes, unless one considers
this to be an essential flaw in the
art form (‘‘Fie, Fie unknit thy
threatening, unkind brow’’),

Instead this review might have
mentioned just once the name of
Mr. Paul Hofstetler, under whose
direction ‘‘The Taming of the
Shrew’? became a well-balanced,
well-paced, dynamic production in
which a number of actors dis-
played an uncontestable talent.

In short, Mr. Kopff and Miss
Ford -interacted with a vibrant
cast to present, in my opinion,
one of the finest shows seen on
the Haverford and Bryn Mawr
campuses in the past four years.

Reviewer's Notes

To “Critical Holocausts”:
I never felt under sub-
jection, nor did I feel the

evening unpleasant or fruitless!

I am more flattered than you
know, and undoubtedly more than
you intended, by your reference
to Alexander Woolcott in relation
to my review, I wish I were of
his calibre, in the business of
writing caustic, verbal holocausts
or of metamorphizing, but I am
not, In order to metamorphoze at
all however, one must first see
a definite form in one’s raw
material, This is easy with a
diamond, or with a porcupine, but
more difficult with sludge,

Mary Laura Gibbs
To “Distorted View”: Mire

Glad you thought so!

I did not say that Petruchio
was allowed to overcome Kate.
I said that Chris Kopff was al-
lowed to overpower Kay Ford.
The idea of love at first sight
is a very common and comple-
tely believable interpretation of
the meeting of Kate and Petruchio;
I regretted that this interpreta-
tion was betrayed in our product-
ion only for a matter of seconds,
in their glance before either spoke,
and subsequently shelved.

Pass/Fail |

To the Editor:
Yale University has just insti-
tuted a new method of grading,

‘the pass/fail system, thus setting

a precedent for overdue revisions
within a system immutable for so
many years, Shouldn’t Bryn Mawr
take this opportunity to reconsider
the value of its present grading
methods? After devoting an entire
year to the infinite problems pre-
sented by the school’s calendar,
shouldn’t we now turn to the equally
compelling question: have we not

-gutgrown our grading system?

Our present grading system is
based on a scale from 0 to 100,
its purpose is to give a just and
meaningful evaluation of a. stu-
dent’s work, But what are its
results? It provides a reward
or stimulus for achievement, Un-
fortunately, the grade often be-
comes the only stimulus, thus
defeating the attempt to instill
in the student a desire for learn-
ing.
meaningful evaluation of the stu-
dent’s work--is such an evaluation
at all feasible under this system?
What is the standard used in de-
ciding whether a paper is to receive
an 82 or 83? Often a professor
is forced to spend time devising
a system by means of which he
can make such an unnecessary
distinction, time that he might
rather spend criticizing the papers
in greater detail, Not only is it
impossible to distinguish between
an 82 and an 83, but it is also
impossible for a professor to es-
tablish the absolute value of a

grade, How canthere bea common.

standard? (As weall know, a paper
which gets an 81 in one English
Comp, course may well reap a
paltry 69.7 in another, Where is
the basis fora just evaluation?)

If our present system encourages’

competition, by setting up symbols
of accomplishment, it should at
least provide an objective basis
for these symbols,
There are many alternatives
within the basic framework of a
pass/fail system, for example,
the honor-satisfactory-unsatis-
factory system, In any pass/fail
system the emphasis shifts from
grades which assume inherent but
misleading values, to comments

-which not only evaluate the spe-

cific papers, but which also lead
to brief but comprehensive analy-
sis of student’s progress and de-
velopment, Too often we are left
to infer comments from numbers,
A pass/fail system enables stu-
dents to work for knowledge and
not for rank in class. Private
standards replace group stand-
ards, (A new system might even
prevent a few neurotic traumas!)

We realize that we have treated
this problem only superficially,
omitting some issues. while only
touching others, Nevertheless we

What issues can be sorted out of the tangle of petitions

and minor changes and disappointments involved in the

question of majoring at Haverford while attending Bryn
Mawr? ;

One issue that becomes clear is a certain narrow-
mindedness. Bryn Mawr has a special experience to offer
to its students, and they come to this college to take
advantage of it.

But it can’t give every kind of a course from every kind
of an approach. Where it is lacking, it is lucky to have
Haverford so nearby to complement its curriculum and
faculty. Haverford students major in Italian, Archeology,
History of Art, Geology, and Anthropology at Bryn Mawr
because they can find nothing comparable at their own
school. The merging of the history. and economic depart-
ments of Haverford and Bryn Mawr indicates a recogni-
tion of the courses of both schools as valuable for a major.
Why is there no recognition of the difference between some
Bryn Mawr and Haverford departments, each of which
might be valuable to different kinds of students?

Another thing Bryn Mawr cannot do is determine in
what way a student will become excited about learning.
It can’t guarantee that the source of a student’s excitement
will be found within the Bryn Mawr curriculum.

This brings up the issue of how students choose a
major, and why they find Bryn Mawr’snarrowmindedness
about majoring restricting. One girl interviewed by the

NEWS described her-courses in the religion departmentat

~~Haverford as opening her mind to new ways of thinking “©
and as teaching her to discuss and deal with problems
_- dn the next few weeks. oe"
,,
cn1967-12-01.txt,"['Letters to the Editor', 'To the Editor:', 'To the Editor:']","

There is a way to criticize
while being tactful. The course
evaluation sheet seems to have
been written in some places by
people who do not know anything
of these two qualities. In a num-
ber of cases the compiled com-
ments were vindictive and destruc-
tive rather than constructive. I
think that in some cases a eee
ple most eager to respond were
those who disliked the course the
most and were eager to take crack
shots at their ‘“tormenters.” In
many instances the comments re-
corded showed a complete lack of.
humanity and feeling, even though
the criticisms may be somewhat

. valid.

It is necessary to have some
way of communicating student feel-
ings about courses to the profes-
sors, but it should not have to
descend to the level af personal
insults and disrespect.

FREE Slates March



On Main Line District

A march from the Suburban
Theater in Ardmore to the Main
Line Board of Realtors in Bryn
Mawr will occur this Saturday,
December 2, at 10 a.m., under
the sponsorship of Project FREE
(For Real Estate Equality)

The purpose of the march is to
put pressure on the Board of
Realtors to cease discriminatory
practices against non-whites who
seek housing on the Main Line.

Project FREE was founded two
years ago, and is comprised of
housewives, clergymen, college
students, and businessmen, most
of whom live along the Main Line.

FREE is demanding that the
board give equal service to all
home-seekers, that it refuse to
accept discriminatory listings, and
that it co-operate with and share
real estate commissions with non-
discriminatory brokers.

It is specifically demanding that
the board Sead to meet the housing

they had an important role in their.
own government, we thought, they
might feel less alienated from
Bryn Mawr and find a construc-
tive role to play within it.' Even
if this effort on our part has had
some success -- and EF am not
at all sure this is so -- it is but
a very small part of what needs
to be done.

If students are to feel them-
selves a part of a community at
Bryn Mawr, they must be able
to find here meaningful endeavor
which they share with.other mem-
bers of the community. ‘Students
seldom discuss academic mat-
ters except the night before a
test. Why is there such a current
of  anti-intellectualism? What
changes could we make in the
academic program at Bryn Mawr
that would make students find more
significance in what is, after all,
the purpose of their presence here?
Where is the new creative arts
program for which money has been
appropriated? Should we_ not
examine again the reasons for
the divorce of creative arts and~
academics?

, Community Disintegration

we are to discover the foun-
dations of the disintegration of
community at Bryn Mawr, we must
ask sweeping questions about the
nature and philosophy of the Col-
lege, the student government, the
faculty, and the students. Such
questioning seems a beginning to
the only constructive role possible
in the face of what I see asa
disintegration of the purpose of
Bryn Mawr.

Self Gov obviously cannot do
all of this. The problems we see
around us now cannot be dealt
with by the legislative and judi-
cial functions which Self Gov has
performed in the past. I hope that.
we can initiate the radical group
self-examination which I see as
necessary to an attempt to make
Bryn Mavr have a significance as
a community.

have you:ever thought about
dropping out? not out of school,
not even out of life really, but
just a sort of physical dropping
out, becoming invisible so that
you wouldn’t have to talk to peo-
ple anymore but could keep on
being around without anyone no-
ticing you.

just think of all the things you
wouldn’t have to worry about if no
one knew you were there: if you
happened to wake up feeling like
you’d spent the night beingdragged —
over rocks, your best friend
wouldn’t get insulted when you
walked glassy-eyed past her in the
hall without speaking. or if you.
walked into a room full of people
and sat down and started reading
‘*time*’? because you didn’t have
anything particularly brilliant you
wanted to say, no one would think
you were being anti-social, or
maybe you had just finished a rough.
afternoon in the geology lab and
what you really wanted to do was
lie on your bed listening to sooth-
ing stereo sounds -- and in walked
lisa to tell you exactly why it was
essential to her moral integrity
to leave bryn mawr and join the
coal miners in appalachia, you
could keep on listening to your
soothing stereo sounds until you |
had recovered because of course
how could she talk to you if you
weren’t there (physically speaking
i mean)?

dropping out (for a week or so
at a time) is probably the answer

-to the world’s: problems. at least

it is to mine. so if you miss my
owl eyes in the dark, don’t get
worried: .i’m still around (spir-

The Mohonk Consultations with 1. How are you to internationalize  tiative to make approaches.

International Students is over. I
am happy to give you a report of
the Consultation and the wonderful
place where it was held.

Mohonk Lake is the greatest thing
that ever happened to life. To try
to describe the beauty will need
some poetry but I am not a poet.
Maybe the best way to describe
the environment is in the words
of a colleague. ‘‘I am not sur-
prised the United Nations never
solves any problems. A man who
has to go through the New York
Subway system or breathe the life
destroying air of New York should
not be expected to solve any pro-
blems. The only thing they need is

to come to Mohonk ‘Lake watch the >

beautiful scenery -- the lake,
house, cliffs, mountains, stars, and
all. of Nature at its glory -- then
they can have the clear head neces-

- sary for problem solving.’’

May I now call the attention of my
readers to the word ‘‘Inter-
national?” This means U.S, isalso
included. More often than not there
is a tendency for (us) American
students to equate ‘international

|... students” with “foreign students.”

There were thirty-three of us,
though the majority were from
~ Africa, Latin-America, The Middle
East and Asia. The chairman was
Mr. Noel J. Brown, Political
Affairs Officer, Dept. of Political
and Security Council Affairs,
United Nations Secretariat , New
York. Our host was The Mohonk
Trust.

Three fields of problems were
explored and many questions ex-
amined. The three areas were:

after attending the Student
Conference on United States
Affairs at West Point. In a note
they attached to the article,

they said they hoped to convey:

the mood of the conference

rather than a strict recounting
of the debates.

The Student Conference on
United States Affairs (SCUSA),
sponsored annually by the United
States Military Academy at
West Point, is, without a doubt,
one of the most elaborately or-
ganized conferences anywhere
in the United States. At the
beginning of November, a letter,
addressed Oct. 9, arrived
informing us of our round table
assignments (South East Asia and
Sub Saharan Africa), supplying
monumental reading lists, a copy
of the complete minutes from the
previous year, instructions on what
to wear and a copy of the bus
schedule to West Point.

We set out for the Military
Academy the first day of the con-
ference feeling rather panicked

and guilty, as we had not opened:

a single book in preparation, On
the bus we were somewhat
reassured to find a fellow delegate
from the University of Chicago,
who had done as much advance
preparation as we, and an official
from the State Department, who
said he was coming as an ‘‘ad-
visor” to one of the discussion
groups, and asked us rather wor-
riedly what his ‘‘responsibilities
would be.’’

No sooner had we arrived in
the hotel lobby, than half a dozen
cadets, rushed forward, grabbed
our suitcases and ushered us to a
series of tables, where we signed
in, filled out forms, received name
badges and chose our classroom
tours (Military Arts, Engineering,
Language, etc.). Unfortunately we
arrived too late to hear the Key-
note Address, by Paul Nitze,

evening was a ‘‘rehash’’ of a

sessions of round table dis-
cussions, lasting two and a
half hours each; a 15 minute coffee
break; and, after supper, before
the nightly reception, a panel dis-
cussion dealing with challenges
and problems of U.S. foreign policy
making. Panelists included repre-
sentatives from the legislative
and executive . branches of the
government, as well as noted
scholars, journalists, and mem-
bers of the Academy.

The round table discussions con-
stituted the heart of the
conference. Each group included
about 15 delegates (there were
well over 100 colleges repre-
sented), a few cadets (who
were picked on a competitive basis
and had been studying intensively
for this event since the beginning
of the school year), a chairman

and an advisor.
The latter two members

were professors or government
officials, with a special knowledge
of the area under discussion. Al-
though each group was given
an outline of questions to follow
(‘principles and goals,’’ ‘‘defense
interests,”  ‘‘policy options,”
etc.), most groups did not
stick to the suggested topics for
discussion. The quality of the dis-
cussions varied greatly, de-
pending upon how well informed
the delegates were, and on the
effectiveness of the chairman.

Starting Comments

Debates were lively, especial-
ly in the South East Asia
group. (The audience was
visibly startled when one delegate
politely raised the question of
whether the United States, and not
China, was the real aggressor
in that part of the world.) How-
ever, at no time did the
dialogue degenerate into name-
calling and undisciplined ar-
gument, Although the majority
of. the members of the Academy
presented decidedly conservative
views, there was a surprising
number of members whopresented
liberal viewpoints.

SCUSA provided an excellent
opportunity for the delegates to
observe the life of the West Point
cadet. Our first exposure occurred
early Thursday morning, when all
the guests attended an ‘‘orienta-
tion on cadet life.” We wit-
nessed a series of skits,
performed and narrated by the
cadets, plus a movie and slide
presentation.

Graduate Deferments

To the Editor:

Last Monday, I was talking to
four members of a large univer-
sity’s physics department in
connection with a political science
paper.

We talked a while about how |

deferments for graduate school
have been eliminated, and they
brought up an idea which I think
should be considered for the men
graduate students here. They said
that maybe they could save their
first-year students by having them
take three units of research right
away, thereby giving them second
year status, while not having act-
ually spent two years (chronologic -
ally) in graduate school.

I don’t know if this idea could
be adapted to Bryn Mawr’s credit
system, or if it is possible in areas
other than the natural sciences,
but I think it is worth looking
into.

‘I think this is a good idea. Bryn
Mavr College has no obligation to
feed the American war machine
(which is apparently badly in need
of help). Rather it has a def-
inite duty to continue functioning
as an institution of American higher
. education. The two are incom-
*” patible. We must choose.

Honor Hassles

To the Editor:

Having been here only five
months, I don’t know whether
these hassles go on all the time,
' but they certainly seem to be a
permanent phenomenon. The has-

gles about the honor system, that

is; their perpetuity must imply
something about their effect-
iveness.

“We welcome you to Bryn
Mawr,’’ say the Ubiquitous They,

and don’t reach for the sticks and
stones: this is not an “‘apathy’’
‘letter, nor is it an ‘“‘ingrate’’
letter. I rejoice in being trusted



Letters. to the Editor



to pursue my own inclinations.
This letter merely explores the
reasons for these endless
discourses on the honor system
(whose self-contradictory title is
itself a springboard for debate).

The question of the honor sys-
tem is a fine election issue. It
is also a real fun topic that you
can kill time with and think you’re
doing something useful. It’s easy
to get opinionated on, it’s intricate
enough to hold attention. The sys-
tem has that nice balance: ben-
eficial enough to praise in contrast
with other schools; hypocritical

enough to malign in contrast with

whatever it is we want from this
school.
The honor system is plainly an
ideal debate topic. i

Affect or Reflect?

To the Editor:

Since I do not know Kathryn
Seygal, my response to her let-
ter is not against her personal-
ly, but against the prevalent at-
titude she expresses.

First, it is necessary to dis-
entangle gripes against Self Gov.
and gripes against the administra-
tion--too often everything we’re
discontented about gets pushed into
one category and cursed as a
whole. We can control the matters
of Self. Gov; the living conditions
are up to the administration. Just
because we as students aren’t all-
powerful, let’s not sneer at what
influence we do have. We can’t
personally repair the plumbing
of the showers in Pem East, but we
can sign out. and act as ladies--
so let’s do that.

One of the differences between
my point of view and the one ex-
pressed in last week’s letter is
basic. Do the rules of Self Gov
affect or merely reflect the situ-

ation? Unless:we are perfectly:

Satisfied with things the way they
are (which obviously no one is)
then we want to affect it. But
anything positive be accomplish-
ed by those who become nauseat-
ed at the thought of discussing
‘‘morality, community and hon-
or’’?

Being a member of the Bryn
Mawr community is ear ane
by preserice here; the ‘living,
breathing” - part, is up to the in-
dividual. Those who are’ cleaning
out their closets when import-
ant decisions are being made are
dead weight when the ‘‘organism”’
moves in a direction they didn’t
help determine.

Many students besides myself
hold opinions that differ from
Kathryn Seygal’s as I have dis-
covered in talking to various stu-
dents around campus. Many may
respond to her letter. Many may
not. If not, I know in this case,
that silence does not mean con-

\ Short Signout

Sigma have always been considered
a safety measure at Bryn Mawr. The
information supplied is to be used to
locate the student in case of an emer-
gency. Accepting this premise, the cur-
rent signout system should be changed
to include only the information essential
to its function.

The present system and the fact that
many students are unwilling’ to follow it
are evidence of its failure. Many students
dislike the publicity resulting from others
reading their signouts, and do not wel-
come moral judgments on their behavior
from hall presidents. Preferring not to
write a detailed description of where they
are going and with whom, they are tempted,
and often forced, to use false signouts.
Two dangerous situations are the results:
1) the value of the signout as a means
of locating someone is negated, and 2)
students are violating their own honor
by disregarding the honor system.

“Since reaching the student is the primary

‘purpose of the signout, it seems that only
two facts are necessary: the expected ~
‘time of return, and a telephone number

where the student can be reached. N.M

book as suggestions.

These rules included such regulations
as riding bicycles after dark only if
equipped with lights and riding on the
P & W Railroad only in groups of three
or more,

When these items came to a vote, it
was decided to retain em in the body
of the constitution.

The Self Gov Charter states that ‘‘the
regulation of the conduct of the students
in their College life has been entrusted
in general to the students themselves.”’
Since Self Gov is a body formed for this
purpose and for the purpose of: main-
taining and preserving an honor system,
its constitution is an embodiment of the
honor system. All rules in the con-
stitution therefore, belong to the honor
system.

This means that riding a bicycle after
dark without lights constitutes a violation
of the honor system and is an immoral
act,

It seems rather harsh, and also rather
ludicrous that such actions be considered
dishonorable. When violations like these
are as much a violation otk one’s honor
as rules affecting hours, drinking and

absences from. the college (which cer- .

tainly have a far greater importance to
the college community), there is something
wrong with the system. It would be
more appropriate. were such items merely
suggested behavior, and not the basis of
judgment on a student’s morality.

I suggest that. students re-read their

‘Self Gov constitutions and consider the

possibility of removing these items from
it and) putting them into the handbooks

According to an article in

last week’s NEWS, some members -

of the faculty and administration
complained of ‘‘slanders’’ in last
semester’s course evaluation,
The course evaluation committee,
too, apparently wished that the

comments had been more
“objective” -- whatever - that
means,

I wrote three of the evaluations
in the booklet, and read the entire
booklet with care, I did not find
anything that could remotely be
described as slanderous, or even
cruel, There were many adverse
criticisms of professors, and not
all of these comments were tact-
ful, However, there is a con-
siderable difference between

- bluntness and slander,

The purpose of the course
evaluation is to guide students
in selecting their courses, The
students are the only people who

regularly < the professors teach;

therefore;they are the ones best>-

equipped to judge the professors’
competence as teachers, at least
in the short run, In these .cir-
‘cumstanees, honesty is far more
important than tact or objectivity.

Let me take an_ illustra-
tion from my own experience,
In the questionnaires for one of
the cqurses I evaluated--one I
had.-not taken--nearly all the stu-

dents _ reported that the in-
structor was incompetent, I
reported this opinion in the

evaluation in terms as blunt as
those used by the respondents, In
honesty and fairness to my fellow
students, I could not have done
otherwise,

If a teacher is incompetent,
the students who may consider tak-
ing his courses in the future
have the right to be so informed,
so that they will not waste their
time, And they should be so in-
formed in clear and explicit terms,
without having to interpret nice--
‘Nellie evasions in which ‘‘incom-
petent’’ becomes _indistinguish-
able from ‘could be improved,’’
Tact is great when you’re tell-

_ Letters to the Editor

ing your roommate that her
new hairdo is unbecoming.
But when you’re trying to help your
fellow students make the best pos-
sible use of their four years
in college, tact and objectivity
just aren’t of the essence,

Even an_ incompetent -in-
structor should not be subjected
to vicious personal attacks, No
human being should, But does
describing someonw as a poor
teacher constitute a vicious per-
sonal attack, or a _ slander?
Are all of us here, students, fac-
ulty, and administration, such
babies that we cannot take crit-
icism except in a sugar-
coated pill?

For $1850, we are entitled
to teachers who have a firm com-
mand of their subject, and

“who are capable of communicat-

ing their knowledge and of
stimulating and challenging the
students’ minds, Anything less is
inexcusable, If the faculty fails
to provide such teaching, and the
administration fails to hire such
teachers, they are cheating us,

In four years here, I have.
had enough incompetent, dull, un-~

inspired, and apathetic teachers
to know that, in many cases, we

"" are being cheated, (I have alsohad

several excellent teachers; and,
indeed, the booklet indicates that
students recognize superior teach-
ing and do _ not hesitate to
praise it highly.) A faculty and an

Corrective Measures

accuracies that appeared in the

Those of us who participated
in the Model U.N. appreciate your
recognition of our effort, but there
are some points in last week’s
article that need clarification. Pri-
marily, I must object to the sev-
eral references to the Congo
(Brazzaville) as ‘insignificant.’
Granted, it is not an important
power, but it seems somewhat
presumptuous to call a nation ‘‘in-
significant’ just because it does
not happen to play a great part
in our little lives. We were rather
startled to receive it as our as-
.Signment, but we realized that
schools which participated in re-
gional assemblies were given pref-
erence, and we went to work with
what we had, The idea of the
Model U.N, is to learn how the

U.N. works by operating asa dele-
gation interacting with other dele-
‘gations in committee, bloc and
General Assembly sessions, not
_by striving to be a ‘‘big wheel’
for its own sake, Our purpose
is education, not glory-seeking.

to thank the members of our group

-- Carol Curtis, Martha Gell-
man, Patty Gerstenblith, Diane
Jordan, Joyce Rheimherr, Betsy
Rudd and Suki Zimicki -- for their
fine participation in spite of it
all.

To the Editor:

Kit Bakke’s assertion that Self
Gov has’ been forced by the Ad-
ministration to issue its interpre-
tation of last fall’s drug statement
is unjustified. The essential fact
to Self Gov in the marijuana ques-
tion is not whether or not mari-
juana is immoral. We believe,
as we have stated upon.numerous
occasions since last March, that
morality is a matter for individ-
ual choice. Our concern, the con-
cern of government, must be the
welfare of the community:

As a government, our first con-
sideration in regard to marijuana
is that it is illegal, Bryn Mawr
is not autonomous, and, therefore,

have retreated to their rooms for

sports activities to keep their
spirits up during the bleak sea-

Four varsity and junior var-.

sity sports teams have been hold-

matches both here and away with
other college teams.

The fencing team has won two

with Goucher and Jersey State.
Bryn Mawr beat Goucher 6-3 and
Jersey State 5-4. Goucher beat

meet, Bryn Mawr won over Bar-

nard 11-5. Rayette Nee is captain

and Sue Zakaluk is manager of
this year’s fencing team.

the fighting spirit and concern for
their community expressed by all

However, Sally Dimschultz

student spends about 32 months of
her life with the Self-Gov Assoc-

us. The rest of us hav& found that
our actions do affect the commun-

we alumnae, at the other end of the
generation gap, will be that ‘girl
in the next room.’” I suggest that
when we wish to change our social
mores, as we obviously do at the
present time, the change is brought
about by’ a painful and slow process
of self-examination, persuasion
and mutual accomodation.

It seems ludicrous to suggest

Not for fun, but for fellowship,
some of us foreign students got to-

American students. Peruvian, In-

and even Foreign Students’ Advisor

served buffet style.

Food ‘did provide us all with the
common ground from which we en-

In order to clarify apparent mis-
understandings, I would like to pre-
sent further information concern-
ing the Faculty-Student_ Curric-
ulum Committee meeting on Tues-
day, April 9th,

Although the preliminary study
presented at that meeting was con-
ducted under the aegis of the Stu-

dent Curriculum Committee, most

of the information was researched
by the two girls who hadexpressed
the initial interest. -Indeed, they
were the only ones who seemed
willing to devote ALL their time
to accomplish something positive.

At the April 9th meeting, they .

reported the results of the work
completed SO FAR, including the
responses to the questionnaire,
This was intended to serve merely
as a study of the attitudes of both
Bryn Mawr students and faculty
members. The results were not
represented as final, particularly
since only 178 students and 34fac-
ulty members replied. Indeed,

, the figures were quoted directly

several times.

In addition, the girls were spec-
ifically asked as chairmen to give
their own proposal after relating
the results of the preliminary
questionnaire. This was suggested
since they had done the major part
of the research for the study and
were familiar with the current ine
formation. They distinguished, at
least to my satisfaction, between

their own opinions and those rep-

resented by the responses to the
questionnaire. It is unfortunate
that once again imperfect commun-
ication might further delay or
hinder progress,
Hopefully, in the future, any
questions and differences that
might arise will be voiced first to
those most directly involved who
can reply most accurately,

Journey Across Siberia

Miss Frances de Graaff, chair-
man of the Russian department,

and Mrs, Ruth Pearce, assistant*

professor of Russian, spent an un-
forgetable month this summer rat-
tling through Siberia onthe Trans-
Siberian Railroad, This is how
it happened:

Miss de Graaff and Mrs. Pearce
flew to San Francisco, where they

Franklin and Marshall’s Russian
department. Then they flew on to
Tokyo.

In Yokahama, a portnear Tokyo,
they boarded. a Russian steamer,
A three-day and two-night trip
with ‘‘a motley crew,’’ as Miss
de Graaff put it, brought them to
Nakhodka in Siberia, The reason
for such divergenée among the
passengers was that the Trans-
Siberian Railroad provides the in-
expensive way for Orientals, Aus-
tralians and others to get to
Europe,

Miss de Graaff and Mrs. Pearcé
can. testify that many of their
fellow passengers made the trip
on virtually no money. They be-
friended and nourished an English
boy and a Japanese boy who were
subsisting during the trip on bread,
the cheapest food available,

The train was dirty and uncom-
fortable- too hot in the daytime,
too cold at night, Nevertheless,
the Russian professors concur that
the trip was worth the physical
discomforts, for it gave them the
opportunity to meet a true cross-
section of the people--starting with
the big, red-faced woodsman who
apologized for his lack of edu-
cation, explaining that he was
originally from Lithuania and that
every time he would finish a grade
of school, the country would be
captured by a different power, and
he would have to begin again;
and ending with ‘the woman of the
streetcar who really wanted to hear
about the standard of living in
America, but after having heard,
added, ‘‘But, then, you have a lot
less freedom there, don’t you?’

Miss de Graaff and Mrs. Pearce
found the people proud of their own
cities and each city. flourishing
with much new construction, From
Irkutsk, ‘an old city in eastern
Siberia, they made an excursion to
Lake Baikal, the largest fresh
water lake in Asia and the deepest
lake in the world, There they ate
specially prepared fish, admired
the crystal clear water but
declined to bathe because of the
frigid water,
